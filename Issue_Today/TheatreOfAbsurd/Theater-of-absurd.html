    <h3>Britain</h3>
    <h4>Matt Wolf, London Theater Critic</h4>
    <p class="capital">Theater of the absurd has nothing on the bizarre scenario endured by Britain’s playhouses during <time datetime="2020">2020</time>. March 16 was the first of several doomsdays on which the coronavirus pandemic forced them to close their doors, bringing to a halt a
      theatrical economy worth billions of pounds.</p>
    <p>Then came months of nothing, followed by the gradual emergence of outdoor shows, then indoor performances, when financially practical: no big musicals or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" target="_blank"><span class="person">Shakespeare</span></a>, just bite-size plays, performed in auditoriums newly configured to meet
      government guidelines.</p>
    <p>Several pioneering venues — the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Theatre" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Bridge Theater</span>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank"><span class="place">London</span></a>, pre-eminently — opened again at the end of the summer, but not for long. They, too, were shuttered again by a second lockdown, in early November — albeit a shorter one, which lifted on
    <span class="date"> Dec. 2.</span></p>
    <p>This was replaced by a tiered system of geographical restrictions, which meant that theaters in parts of the country were open, while others had to stay shut. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank"><span class="place">London</span></a>, this critic’s diary was briefly filled with press night appointments that
      recalled the halcyon days of old. But now, as of <span class="date">Dec. 16</span>, the city has entered the grim “Tier 3,” and that surge in activity has proved to be short-lived — at least for in-person performances, rather than events streamed via the internet.</p>
    <p>Theaters have responded to these whiplash changes with a nimbleness that wasn’t in evidence this time last year. (Equally improbable back then was the notion of socially distanced seating, with legroom worthy of an airline’s first class.)
      Shows have learned to be readily adaptable for online distribution: That was the path taken by “Death of England: Delroy,” the production chosen to reopen the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" target="_blank"><span class="entity">National Theater</span></a>, in November. Its opening night turned out to be the closing one, too,
      when the second national lockdown was announced, but it went out on YouTube later that month. That brought <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Williams_(playwright)" target="_blank"><span class="person">Roy Williams</span></a> and <span class="person">Clint Dyer</span>’s fiery solo play to audiences worldwide, and confirmed the prevailing awareness that smaller was better in these
      corona times.</p>

    <p>Sure, we’ve learned to embrace Zoom and YouTube to savor virtual productions, which are preferable to none at all. But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank"><span class="place">London</span></a> feels ready to return to full theatrical form as soon as conditions allow — and if not? Well, this strange new normal
      should give Britain’s playwrights something to write about, for a long while to come.</p>

  <section id="France">
    <h3>France</h3>
    <h4>Laura Cappelle, Paris Theater Critic</h4>
    <p>On paper, French theater has been relatively lucky in this pandemic year.
      Buoyed by high levels of public funding for the arts and rounds of government support, most venues resumed performances between the country’s first lockdown, from March to May, and the second, which started in late October.
      No major company or theater has been forced to close its doors permanently (yet).
      That’s more than many Western countries can say.</p>
    <p>Yet <time datetime="2020">2020</time> often felt like “Groundhog Day” — a never-ending grind of closures, reopenings, restrictions and curfews which, based on conversations with artists and administrators, has left many bone tired.
      Perceived slights to the culture sector, so integral to France’s identity, have bred resentment.
      While the country’s new culture minister, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roselyne_Bachelot" target="_blank"><span class="person">Roselyne Bachelot</span></a>, appointed last July, scored points with the sector in the summer and early fall,
      the planned reopening of theaters and cinemas in December has now been postponed until January at the earliest, and the grumbling has returned.</p>
    <p>When theaters could welcome audiences, their hit rate seemed higher than in past seasons: Perhaps scarcity heightened the thill.
      In early October, the Comédie-Française troupe teamed up with the film director <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christophe_Honoré" target="_blank"><span class="person">Christophe Honoré</span></a> for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time" target="_blank"><span class="entity">The Guermantes Way</span></a>", a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Proust" target="_blank"><span class="person">Proust</span></a> adaptation that struck the perfect balance between immersion and irreverence.
      At the <span class="entity">Théâtre Gérard Philipe</span>, <span class="person">Margaux Eskenazi</span> and <span class="person">Alice Carré</span> tackled the legacy of the Algerian decolonization war with great finesse in “And the Heart Is Still Steaming.”</p>
    <p>Comedy, meanwhile, often felt like a public service.
      From a warm reinvention of an 18th-century original (<span class="person">Emmanuelle Bayamack-Tam</span>’s “À l’Abordage!”) to the absurd humor of the excellent <span class="entity">Chiens de Navarre collective</span>,
      comedians played their part in keeping us sane.</p>
    <p>As happened everywhere else, streams of recorded productions mushroomed during the two lockdowns, but these felt like a consolation prize, rather than an area of genuine innovation.
      French theater is very attached to its extensive network of brick-and-mortar venues, and the priority was to get back to the stage.</p>

        <img src="Issue_Today/TheatreOfAbsurd/images/image_3.png" alt="Cabaret Under the Baclonies"f>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    <p>One notable exception was <span class="person">Marion Siéfert</span>’s "<span class="entity">Jeanne Dark</span>", billed as the first French play to be offered live and via Instagram simultaneously.
      <span class="person">Helena de Laurens</span>, the superb lead, played a teenager who confides in her followers, in a long Instagram Live session, about her Catholic parents and joyless school life.</p>
    <p>At La Commune in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" target="_blank"><span class="place">Paris</span></a> suburb of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubervilliers" target="_blank"><span class="place">Aubervilliers</span></a>, where it was created in October, the audience witnessed <span class="person">de Laurens</span> filming herself,
      while Instagram users saw the show in real time on Jeanne’s fictional account.
      <span class="entity">“Jeanne Dark,”</span> which is set to tour in <time datetime="2021">2021</time>, wryly captures the gap between the two-dimensional feed and reality.</p>
    <p>This year has been a reminder that our definitions of theater are sometimes too narrow: Performances outside the big urban institutions are part of France’s culture, too.
      The first show to be staged after the spring lockdown, <span class="person">Léna Bréban</span>’s "<span class="entity">Cabaret Under the Balconies</span>", took place at a nursing home 200 miles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" target="_blank"><span class="place">Paris</span>,
      and I can’t think of a more fulfilling experience this year than sitting with the elderly residents to watch pared-down song and dance numbers after months of isolation.</p>
    <p>And if events that look a lot like performances are going to take precedence over theaters when coronavirus restrictions are eased, then they should probably be reviewed, too.
      The whiz-bang productions on offer at the <span class="entity">Puy du Fou</span>, a historical theme park, reopened early to much controversy, in June; in late November,
      the drama of the Catholic Mass returned to France’s churches, though playhouse doors remain shut.</p>
    <p>A critic’s job doesn’t have to stop when the curtain comes down. All the world’s a stage, after all.</p>

  <section id="Germany and Austria">
    <h3>Germany and Austria</h3>
    <h4>A.J. Goldmann, Berlin Theater Critic</h4>
    <p>This was the year when going to the theater became a matter of life and death: Who was willing to risk catching a deadly virus just to enjoy some <span class="person">Shakespeare</span>?</p>
    <p>In the German-speaking world, as everywhere, theater was among the first causalities of the pandemic.
      One by one, premieres were canceled, then the festivals, too. It’s still unclear what the fate of all of those productions will be.
      But luckily, the future of the performing arts themselves doesn’t hang in the balance, as it seems to in other parts of the world.</p>
    <p>The deep conviction in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank"><span class="place">Germany</span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" target="_blank"><span class="place">Austria</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" target="_blank"><span class="place">Switzerland</span></a> that art is valuable to society means that government-sponsored theater, opera and music has had a fighting chance of survival.</p>
    <p>Over the past nine months, I’ve marveled at the resilience.
      I’ve been heartened and impressed by the directors, managers and performers who worked creatively with restrictions to keep the show going under challenging circumstances.</p>
    <p>Quality varied greatly, as it always does, but what mattered most was that companies kept going — even when it meant preforming for a handful of audience members, or just for the cameras.
      Many playhouses began to cleverly redefine the theatrical experience itself, from developing online formats to performing in unusual locations and configurations.
      At the same time, streamed theater came of age, although it often sapped the experience of its live wire excitement and vitality.</p>
    <p>The pandemic forced me to be far less of a roving critic than usual. For the most part, I sheltered in place, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" target="_blank"><span class="place">Munich</span></a>.
      But summer and early fall, with their relative permissiveness, seem now like some long-ago idyll. Lockdown lifted, and I was free to travel — with P.P.E. and disinfectant, of course.</p>

      </figure>
    <p>In early June, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staatstheater_Stuttgart" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Stuttgart State Theaters</span></a>, in the south of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" target="_blank"><span class="place">Germany</span></a>, triumphantly drew back their curtains with a theatrical walkabout that was as momentous as it was meticulously executed.
      It was, without a doubt, the production of the year. Then came the defiant centenary edition of the <span class="entity">Salzburg Festival</span>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" target="_blank"><span class="place">Austria</span></a>.
      It deserves a 21-gun salute for realizing its reduced but still formidable installment, which boasted two world premieres in its dramatic program, including one from a Nobel laureate.
      Subsequent stations for me included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig" target="_blank"><span class="place">Leipzig</span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin" target="_blank"><span class="place">Berlin</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg" target="_blank"><span class="place">Hamburg</span></a> — and then lockdown hit again.</p>
    <p class="footer">Critics are not in the predication business (except, maybe, when it comes to awards), so I’m not going to speculate about what <time datetime="2021">2021</time> might bring.
      In many places, the pandemic has proved a stress test for the arts and culture.
      Yet the coronavirus has not exposed fault lines and structural problems for the arts in the German-speaking world the way it has in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"><span class="place">United States</span>.
      When the public health crisis is over, there won’t be much need for the theaters, opera houses and orchestras here to “build back better.” That, in itself, is reason for optimism.</p>
