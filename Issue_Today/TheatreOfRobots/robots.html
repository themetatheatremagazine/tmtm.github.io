               <h3>Abstract</h3>
               <p class="capital">Stage plays, theories of theatre, narrative studies, and robotics research can serve
                  to identify, explore, and interrogate theatrical elements that support the effective performance of
                  sociable humanoid robots.
                  Theatre, including its parts of performance, aesthetics, character, and genre, can also reveal
                  features of human–robot interaction key to creating humanoid robots that are likeable rather than
                  uncanny.
                  In particular, this can be achieved by relating <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>'s (<time datetime="1970/2012">1970/2012</time>) concept of total
                  appearance to realism.
                  Realism is broader and more subtle in its workings than is generally recognised in its
                  operationalization in studies that focus solely on appearance. For example, it is complicated by
                  genre. A realistic character cast in a detective drama will convey different qualities and
                  expectations than the same character in a dystopian drama or romantic comedy. The implications of
                  realism and genre carry over into real life. As stage performances and robotics studies reveal,
                  likeability depends on creating aesthetically coherent representations of character, where all the
                  parts coalesce to produce a socially identifiable figure demonstrating predictable behaviour.</p>

               <hr>
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s hypothesis of the uncanny valley, illustrated by his graph [see
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>, <time datetime="1970/2012"> 1970/2012</time>], posits a scale of
                  affinity.
                  On the y-axis, this scale of affinity posits not only positive results; it also descends into the
                  negative realm of the uncanny.
                  The x-axis represents a scale of degrees-of-realism of human likeness. <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>'s graph, in short, indicates that the two are causally related.
                  The more realistically humanlike an artificial object appears, the more affinity it will engender in
                  human observers until the tipping point when responses plunge into the uncanny valley before rising
                  again to the figure of the healthy human, which attracts the highest degree of affinity. <a

                        class="person">Mori</span></a> reflects upon reasons for the likability of the <span
                     class="entity">bunraku puppet</span> (Fig. 1) and, in the process, indicates that realism
                  may be a more subtle and broad category than is suggested by degrees-of-realism of appearance. <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a> positions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku"
                     target="_blank"><span class="entity">Bunraku puppet</span></a> as
                  inspiring more affinity on his graph than any other inanimate object, second only to an ill and a
                  healthy person. His reflection reads as follows:
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                  I don’t think that, on close inspection, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku"
                     target="_blank"><span class="entity">Bunraku puppet</span></a> appears
                  similar to a human being.
                  Its realism in terms of size, skin texture, and so on, does not even reach that of a realistic
                  prosthetic hand.
                  But when we enjoy a puppet show in the theater, we are seated at a certain distance from the stage.
                  The puppet’s absolute size is ignored, and its total appearance, including hand and eye movements, is
                  close to that of a human being. So, given our tendency as an audience to become absorbed in this form
                  of art, we might feel a high level of affinity for the puppet. <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>

                        class="person">Mori</span></a> observes that the degree of realism of the physical appearance of
                  the
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Bunraku
                        puppet</span></a> is not high but that, in spite of this, we feel a
                  high level of affinity for it.
                  He indicates that the puppet’s total appearance as a humanlike object is important and incorporates a
                  number of elements, including physical appearance and size as well as hand and eye movements.
                  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s account, the realism of some of these elements offsets or
                  compensates for others that are less-than-realistic.
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a> also indicates that the puppet’s total appearance is bound to its
                  theatrical context in which an audience sits at some distance from the stage and has a ‘tendency […]
                  to become absorbed in this form of art’
               </p>
               <p>It may be that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Bunraku puppet</span></a> belongs more properly on the
                  first peak of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s graph, rather than the second, and that the first
                  peak should be higher than the second.
                  However, as a theatre scholar interested in the design and applications of sociable robots, <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s reflections about how realism connects to total appearance,
                  where
                  total appearance includes elements of physical appearance while extending beyond it, are evocative.
                  Indeed, it is worthwhile to examine more closely the relationship between realism not only to the
                  physical components of an object but also to elements bound up in its context, which frames and
                  directs the way an object is interpreted.
                  In the case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Bunraku puppet</span></a>, the context is the stage,
                  where matters of aesthetics—specifically, character and genre—are important. However, stories and
                  characters are fundamental to real life contexts, too, so have relevance beyond the stage. <a

                  through history to establish communities—social, cultural, political, economic, religious, and so on.
                  Through myths, the imagined order—an inter-subjective phenomenon—embeds itself materially and shapes
                  our desires.</p>
               <p>This paper will examine theatrical parts, processes, and performances with a view to identifying
                  theatrical insights with social implications.
                  Its key questions are: What is indicated by <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s reference to total

                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s notion of ‘total appearance’ connect to realism in creating
                  likeable
                  sociable robots?
                  And what can enhanced knowledge and understanding of theatre—including performance, aesthetics,
                  character, and genre—contribute to research that seeks to create humanlike objects that are likeable
                  as opposed to uncanny?</p>
               <p>Robotics, psychology, narrative studies, and theatre can assist answering these questions, as can
                  analysis of performing robots cast in stage plays in sociable roles.
                  At times, this paper’s analysis and corresponding arguments arise from first-person responses to
                  robots and performing robots.
                  This discussion may sometimes be unsubstantiated by empirical evidence, in the form of, for example,
                  survey results. Such reflections are intended as propositions contributing to ongoing discussions
                  about how to create likeable sociable robots rather than as hard and fast evidence.</p>

               <h3>Making a case for theatre in the work of social robotics</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Theatre can assist in understanding the causes of audience responses to robots where these extend
                  beyond biology and evolutionary psychology. Robots were given form by a dramatic play called R.U.R.<a
                     class="biblioRef" href="#b04">4</a> about a century ago.
                  There are no essential species-specific qualities, processes, or biologically evolved mechanisms that
                  cause humans to like humanlike, but not too humanlike, artificial objects because Homo sapiens did not
                  evolve in an environment populated by android Homo sapiens.
                  Androids evolved, initially, in the imagination, in stories. Studies of the uncanny valley sensibly
                  borrow from areas beyond robotics and animation to theorise that uncanny responses to artificial
                  humanlike objects are likely bound to fear of death, disease, threat, and the unknown (including the
                  supernatural).
                  Such work is important but theatre offers additional explanations to account for audience responses,
                  which are manipulated by stage representations and actions designed to make spectators jump in fright,
                  experience eeriness, or develop strong affinity for a character.
                  Given that the very notion of robots derives from the imagination and a stage play, it is worth
                  considering the role that performance and narrative structures play in our human–robot social
                  engagements by reframing the human–robot relation as a culturally informed one.</p>
               <p>A number of scholars recognize the possibilities and benefits of exploring robotics through theatre
                  and performance, in theory and in practice.
                  Some have focused on ways in which acting theories and approaches can support robotics programming
                  (including Lu and Smart<a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>; <a

                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>) while others have explored how elements of
                  performance—including language,
                  facial expressions, the body, posture, and movement—can be employed expressively in the design and
                  programming of robots (Ishiguro <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>; Lin <a class="biblioRef"

                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>; LePage <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14, 14</a>).
               </p>
               <p>Lu and Smart offer a rationale for the
                  relation between robotics and theatre when they observe that ‘both theatre and HRI aim to replicate
                  some elements of humanity’ and that ‘HRI and theatre are both inherently interactive’ <a
                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  Theatre, they suggest, may be used ‘both as the mode for modeling interactions’—such as with the use
                  of motion capture technology for modelling ways in which human beings move— ‘and as the venue for
                  testing the interactions’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  In the first place, modelling the interactions of actors is useful because actors are highly effective
                  physical performers. Further, as Heather Knight observes, some performance
                  methodologies, such as those of physical theatre, have ‘a long history of encoding and honing
                  expression’ and, as such, provide ‘pre-processed methodologies for interpreting and communicating
                  human non-verbal behaviors’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>. In the second place, the
                  performing arts provide roboticists, as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tzung_De_Lin"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Tzung-De Lin</span></a> observes, with access
                  to the public. For roboticists working on robots aimed to be used in everyday life, particularly in
                  social settings and interactions, the public, in the form of audiences, ‘may be seen as an invaluable
                  resource to be mobilized […] to test people’s responses to robots’ <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a> with a view to making robots with which people will want to interact.</p>
               <p>Theatre also offers a complex multi-person/robot social landscape in which to explore the role and
                  design of robots.
                  <span class="person">Lin</span> suggests that the robot lab is ‘an impoverished imitation of the human
                  “social” world’, that it ‘emphasizes cues, such as gazes and gestures, and certain relationships, such
                  as a caregiver-infant relationship' <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  <span class="person">Lin</span> prefers the stage context, explaining that,
               </p>
               <blockquote>
                  Theater, […] although still limited, provides a much richer model of social interactions through its
                  scenarios and settings.
                  In theatre, robot actors can be embedded in many-to-many social relationships, which not only move
                  beyond the one-to-one relationship typical of human–robot interaction but also are closer to the
                  interactions we experience in everyday life. <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>
               </blockquote>
               <p>This is an important point for those working towards the design of humanoid robots intended for
                  compelling social interactions with people.
                  In the real world, sociable participants are required to fulfil more than one social role at a time.
                  Theatre, while continuing to offer a controlled context, provides a site to test robot characters
                  performing a variety of social roles, e.g. a sister, a daughter, a carer, a friend, and so on, in a
                  variety of social settings.</p>
               <p><span class="person">Lin</span> also argues that theatre can offer an effective medium for fostering
                  acceptance of robots as sociable characters.
                  Jochum, Vlachos, Christoffersen, Nielsen, Hameed, and Tan <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>
                  propose, more explicitly, ‘that the co-creation of theatre between dramatists
                  and robot researchers can assist the acceptance of social robots by addressing user concerns in
                  specific application scenarios’.
                  Theatre offers lively ‘what if?’ scenarios that allow robotics engineers and theatre-makers,
                  imaginatively, to identify and respond to potential human–robot social situations and relationships,
                  as well as designs and implications for sociable characters and roles.

               </p>
               <p>Theatre obviously does not enjoy the cultural reach of films or the novel. However, theatre’s
                  liveness—its temporal and physical proximity to audiences—gives it the capacity.</p>
               <p>Theatrical structures and processes can assist in the creation and direction of believable, humanlike
                  robots, which, lacking high-level intelligence and personality or character themselves, can
                  nonetheless be made to appear as if they possess such qualities.
                  Indeed, some theatre-makers have produced startling results by drawing artfully upon theatrical
                  methods to create character.
                  The performance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span

                  (This performance will be analysed in some depth in the next section.)</p>
               <p>Before closing this section, a few words of caution about employing theatre in robotics research.
                  Stage characters are coherent and meaningful in a way that people in real life rarely are.
                  In Western drama, a character generally acts according to coherent objectives, which are meaningful in
                  the broader terms of the narrative and its themes.
                  In contrast, as <span class="person">Lin</span> observes, ‘(a)ctual social situations are much
                  noisier’ and ‘the information communicated by actions is less clear’ <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a>.
                  Theatre, then, offers a relatively complex laboratory context, which encourages emotional and critical
                  engagement with stage actor-characters, but it remains a laboratory that simplifies much messier
                  real-world contexts.
                  In certain respects, of course, this may be an advantage for robotics researchers seeking to explore
                  specific elements in a controlled setting.</p>
               <p>Also, stage robots, unlike autonomous social robots designed for real-world scenarios, are not
                  sociable characters or participants; they are aesthetic objects representing sociable characters or
                  participants.
                  This is important because audiences read aesthetic objects differently to objects they encounter in
                  real life.
                  On stage, nothing is really happening; the dramatic stakes for characters are not real.
                  There is no tangible, impending risk to characters or audience members, and audiences are perfectly
                  aware of this.
                  Given this, and given the semantic connection of fear with uncanny responses, it may be that robots
                  cast in stage scenarios reduce the potential for uncanny audience reactions.</p>
               <p>A connected point of caution is that aesthetic objects and their actions are always overdetermined.
                  They are loaded with meaning in a way that ordinary objects in everyday life are not.
                  If a cup is dropped in your kitchen, you will probably think nothing of it other than that the person
                  who dropped it was momentarily clumsy or careless.
                  On stage, however, unless you are led to believe otherwise, you read the dropping of the cup as an
                  intentional and meaningful action.
                  A character who drops a cup may be interpreted as being nervous or inherently clumsy or showing signs
                  of an onset of an illness.</p>
               <p>It might be argued, of course, that robots are themselves overdetermined entities, even in real life,
                  and that they will remain so until they have become sufficiently ubiquitous that they become
                  mundane.Robots are always ‘meaningful’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  We see this if we consider the ‘resting’ robot. Lu and Smart observe that a robot is ‘often programmed
                  to have “idle animations”
                  which serve no explicit purpose, other than to communicate to others that it is active and ready, not
                  dead’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  Robots, unlike humans or animals, are always signifying, even when they are doing nothing. They are
                  not alive and have yet to become ordinary so while this is the case, theatre remains a compelling
                  ‘what if?’ setting for the exploration of their design, character, and setting.</p>

            <section id="The Status of Mind">
               <h3>The Status of Mind</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Robots are inherently performative; their identities derive entirely from their performances. They
                  have no essential self to express.
                  Lu and Smart are correct when they observe
                  that, ‘(u)ltimately, all social interactions can be viewed as acting roles which the robot must
                  perform’, indicating that both actors and robots have ‘to get as close as possible to the unobtainable
                  ideal (normal social player/actual character) by giving the correct outputs’ <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a>.
                  However, for the robot, unlike for humans, the ‘correct outputs’ of character are entirely artful and
                  performative, rather than expressive. Given this, the performative design, programming, and
                  contextualisation of sociable robots are crucial to their effective reception.
               </p>
               <p>The robot, akin to the Chinese room in Searle’s thought experiment, does not have a mind that
                  understands, nor does it need one, in order to be perceived as an apparently intelligent and
                  self-determining agent.
                  However, if the sociable robot is to be likeable, it needs more than to perform correct outputs; it
                  needs to appear to be a sociable character, and this means seeming to have a mind.</p>
               <p>The status of mind is important. Though K. Gray and D. M. Wegner’s conclusion may be correct—that the
                  appearance of an experiencing mind in machines is tied to uncanniness <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b08">8</a>—mind per se seems unlikely to be the problem.
                  Indeed, the appearance of mind seems likely to be key in creating sociable robots.
                  What matters is the type of character and mind indicated: just as strong affinity is bound to a
                  meeting of like minds, uncanniness is bound to unpredictable or malevolent characters and minds,
                  rather than mind per se.</p>

               <h3>Science Fiction and the Imagination: How We Perceive Robots</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Human beings are adept at investing objects with personality.
                  We have all seen children play with inanimate toys, bringing them, imaginatively, to life.
                  Birnbaum et al. <a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> (citing Friedman, Kahn, & Hagman [2003] and
                  <span class="person">Lee</span>, Peng,Jin, & Yan[2006]) refer to how ‘(p)eople tend to perceive robots
                  as social actors
                  and attribute to them humanlike traits, including mental states and personality’.
                  My own playful explorations with a Nao robot interacting with groups of people <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a> supports as much.
               </p>
               <p>Before it says or does anything, audiences invest the humanoid robot with the promise, if not the
                  fact, of intelligent autonomy, character, and life.
                  The robot derives this promise in several ways. Firstly, the robot is an inherently science-fictional
                  entity. The very word, ‘robot’, was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_%C4%8Capek"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Karel Čapek</span></a>’s
                  science-fiction play, <span class="entity">R.U.R.</span> (1920/21) <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b04">4</a> to describe humanlike artificial entities, produced in factories, serving
                  humankind as slaves. In the play, these mechanical slaves turn, en masse, against their human
                  oppressors, exterminating them.
                  A couple of the robots, however, take on roles at the end of the play that are akin to those of Adam
                  and Eve in the Garden of Eden, offering the promise of new life in paradise founded on innocence,
                  love, and selflessness.
                  This kind of narrative and set of character roles for robots have repeated themselves in our science
                  fiction stories ever since, in the West if not the East.</p>
               <p>Many real-life robots significantly draw their potential identity from common cultural
                  science-fictional depictions.
                  <span class="person">Kriz</span>, <span class="person">Ferro</span>, <span
                     class="person">Damera</span>, and <span class="person">Porter III</span> <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a> provide evidence that cultural attitudes to robots are bound to
                  science-fictional representations.
                  Exploring ‘the relationship between capabilities of robots portrayed in popular science fiction films
                  and students’ expectations about a real robot’, the authors find that, with a few notable exceptions,
                  expectations map fairly accurately onto their content analysis of science fiction films featuring
                  robots.
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the humanoid robot is invested in the promise of autonomy, character, and life by virtue of
                  its relation to the puppet.
                  However, whereas the puppet has strings that compose a fundamental element of the puppet’s lively
                  appearance and form, the robot’s ‘strings’ are hidden and we are invited to read the object as
                  autonomous and, in its way, alive and self-determining, even when it is not.</p>
               <p>All this has the effect of positioning spectators in cognitive readiness to identify humanoid robots
                  as capable of intentional self-determination and as certain kinds of characters fulfilling certain
                  kinds of roles, including roles that are threatening.
                  From such a starting point, theatrical parts and processes serve to support the imaginative steps of
                  spectators ‘believing’ a humanoid robot is a character, has a mind,<a class="noteRef"
                     href="#n01">1</a> and perceives them back in friendly or unfriendly terms.
                  The humanoid robot need only perform its part well enough for the observer to infer mental states
                  where none exist.</p>

               <h3>An Account of How Audience Reception Theory Explains the Perception of a Robot’s ‘total appearance’
               </h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Understanding how an audience gains an impression of a stage actor’s total appearance, be this actor
                  human, puppet, or robot, can assist the creation of a robot’s total appearance.
                  <span class="person">Elizabeth Ann Jochum</span> and <span class="person">Todd Murphey</span>, writing
                  about uncanny responses to humanlike movement in robots <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>, draw
                  upon theatre scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_O._States" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Bert O. States</span></a>’ influential theory of binocular
                  vision <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  They explain how, in the minds of the audience, the material reality of the stage is brought together
                  with the imaginative realm, comprising mental concepts, which meaningfully identify the physical
                  objects.
                  So, for example, actor is brought together with character, and the real world of the theatre with the
                  fictional world of the play.
               </p>
               <p>Theatre exploits this process for dramatic effect. When audiences watch realistic drama, they watch
                  performances that directors and actors work meticulously to invest with clues, juxtapositions, and
                  gaps, which encourage audiences to perceive particular kinds of characters who have the potential for
                  particular kinds of behaviours.
                  Audiences join the dots of any given performance to construct a picture of a character. They bring
                  their subjective perspectives and their culturally and socially shared knowledge to bear upon their
                  perception of the character, and they assess its potential for action.
                  Is it friend or is it foe? Should we like it or should we fear it? What will it do?</p>
               <p>Roboticists know that ‘the mechanisms underlying perception of individuals in our environment are
                  predictive in nature (Urgen et al. <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>).
                  They know that appearance is bound up with expectations about a given humanlike object and that if
                  one’s predictions about that object are violated, there is the potential for the uncanny to arise.
                  Writing about the relation between appearance and movement, Urgen et al.
                  explain:</p>
               <blockquote>
                  (T)he form (appearance) of the visually presented agent provide(s) a context from which the subject
                  infer(s) how the agent would move over time (e.g. a mechanical/robotic appearance would activate the
                  semantic network that includes motion information associated with robotic appearances),
                  the same way a preceding word group provides a context for the upcoming word in a sentence (e.g. I
                  take coffee with cream and ___ (“sugar” instead of “dog”)), and activates the relevant semantic
                  network associated with the word group.
               </blockquote>
               <p>However, what roboticists sometimes miss is the significance of the humanlike object’s identity and
                  corresponding character, which are implied by all the details of its appearance.</p>

               <h3>How Affinity, Likeability, and Familiarity Are All Important for the Production of Shinwakan</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>The character implied by the physical appearance and performance of a humanlike artificial object is
                  fundamentally important if it is to inspire shinwakan, a neologism of <a

                  English
                  word, ‘affinity’, although ‘familiarity’ and ‘likeability’ are also used.
                  In fact, each of these English terms—affinity, likeability, and familiarity—has a role in producing
                  shinwakan.
                  We need to be familiar with the character type that composes and frames our perception of an
                  artificial humanlike object in order to like or feel affinity with it.

                  knowledge or experience of it.
                  If we have never before encountered bunraku puppetry, we are unlikely to rate the puppet

                  We do not need to have seen a particular object before in order to like it—it can be a stranger to us

                  able to categorise it, to identify it as a character type
                  drawn from our stock of socially and culturally shared stories, be these historical, supernatural,
                  political, expressionistic, comic, melodramatic, romantic, mythic, fairytale, horror, religious,
                  surreal, socially realistic, or whatever.
                  These stories are not merely the stories we read in books or see in films or on the stage, they are
                  the stories that build our conception of the world (to refer back to <span

                  To be strongly likeable, the character of the artificial object needs to appear to be familiar, like
                  us, our potential kin or ‘soul mate’ (MacDorman qtd. in Wang et al. <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a>). Something about it
                  needs to cause us to feel we are ‘in synchrony’ with it, that we are experiencing a ‘meeting of
                  minds’. In short, if we are to experience strongly positive responses to an object, irrespective of
                  its species form, we need to be able to identify it as a friend, not a foe, and predict its
                  corresponding behaviours.</p>

               <h3><em>Three Sisters</em>: Android Version: An Example of a Very Likeable Stage Robot Character</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Character is a powerful element, exploited by theatre-makers casting robot performers in plays.
                  The performances of robots cast as humanlike characters in plays can compensate for flaws in the
                  physical performance of human likeness.
                  Indeed, the form of a humanlike artificial object’s character can operate so powerfully that it
                  overrides the empirical features of its appearance and causes it to become extremely likeable.</p>
               <p>The playwright and director, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata"

                        class="person">Hirata</span></a> has notoriously expounded opinions directly relevant to this
                  paper, including: ‘Actors do not need to have minds’ and ‘Actors need only act like robots’ (Sasaki

                        class="person">Hirata</span></a> positions android performers alongside human ones in
                  naturalistic stage plays with the intention of investing his robot performers with the illusion of
                  mind and character.
                  Avoiding the traditional methods of the naturalistic actor—character work operating at the level of
                  psychology where the actor develops his character’s backstory, relationships, and objectives, with a
                  view to transforming himself into his character—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Hirata</span></a> attends, instead, to the physical details of
                  both his android and human actors’ performances, to make them as close to life as possible.
                  This approach is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s view that ‘(m)ost human communication is not empathic but
                  rather based on learned patterns of response to stimuli’ (qtd. in <span class="person">Poulton</span>
                  <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>).
               </p>
               <p>While this may well be true, it is not sufficient as an account of how audiences respond to robot
                  performers.

                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s employment of hyper-realistic theatrical form works to direct
                  audience attention and expectations in conventional ways, just as <span class="entity">bunraku

                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s example.
                  In theatrical realism and naturalism, the audience, the audience expects to engage with the details of
                  surface performance in order to infer, and focus on, character psychology and, more particularly, the
                  subtext underpinning the staged social interactions, irrespective of the form of the performer.
                  Meticulously choreographing and modulating the physical performances of his human and android actors
                  by attending to volume of speech, length of pauses, vocal intonation, speed of vocal delivery, quality
                  and type of movement, details of facial expressions, and so on, <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a> exploits the audience’s tendency to conflate real and imagined
                  elements in their perception of a stage object’s total appearance.
                  He also exploits the structures of realist and naturalist drama, which operate from the assumption
                  that underneath the surface appearances of human interactions lie psychological character truths.
                  He co-opts these structures to fabricate the sensation of character, consciousness, and agency in his
                  automata without these elements being evident in the robot performers themselves.

                        class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a>’s performances and what are the parts that
                  make them effective? Ishiguro, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1"
                     target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a>’s engineer, holds the view that
                  facial expressions are key to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1"
                     target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a>’s successful performance of its
                  sophisticated android character, where success is judged by the robot’s capacity to make audiences
                  believe in, and weep for, it.
                  Ishiguro argues that while humanlike appearance is important, it is so only insofar as it facilitates
                  the expression of humanlike emotion: ‘(o)f course the robot needs to have a kind of a minimal
                  (humanlike) appearance’; it would be no good for a robot to be, for example, ‘… just a cup or a
                  kettle’ because this would make it ‘difficult to read the human-like emotions’ <a class="biblioRef"

               <p>This seems somewhat disingenuous given the exactitude of human likeness that Ishiguro has evidently
                  aimed for in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a>’s look.
                  It is true that the robot’s highly humanlike face enables audiences to mistake its signs of
                  emotions—its smiles and frowns—as the emotions themselves.
                  Such emotional potential is important for its indication of an individual consciousness, which, in
                  turn, is almost certainly required if empathetic responses are to be prompted in audiences.
                  (We appear to have a tendency to feel for creatures, which themselves appear to feel.) However,
                  Ishiguro has designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a> with a particular look, indicative of a
                  socially significant identity, which signals far more than mere consciousness.
                  This identity operates to direct audience responses to the robot as a certain kind of character.</p>
               <p>The costly avatar-type android character is performed by the robot performer, <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid
                        F</span></a>: a mechanical puppet.
                  Its dialogue is pre-recorded and its movements are those of an actor backstage who operates the robot
                  using a motion tracking system.
                  To what degree is such a mechanical puppet successful at performing its sociable robot-avatar part? On
                  the one hand, it is not successful in that, unlike a human actor, <span class="entity">Geminoid
                     F</span> cannot transform itself physically, mentally, or emotionally into its character.
                  Furthermore, its performance of a conscious and self-determining android character is flawed, with
                  delays in verbal and gestural cues and, overall, there is a woodenness to the robot’s performance.
                  It is insufficiently quick and fluid at responding to the actions of those around it. However, in
                  spite of such flaws, from the perspective of the audience and at the level of its imagination, <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid
                        F</span></a> transforms into android Ikumi.
                  In a review of earlier work by Seinendan Theater Company, also featuring <span class="entity">Geminoid
                     F</span> alongside other robot performers (Robovie R3s), Alexis Soloski remarks: ‘these automata
                  excite <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">…] sympathy to an equivalent, or perhaps even greater, degree
                     than their human counterparts’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>, such that we are prompted
                     to misperceive kinship and feel empathy for them.<a class="noteRef" href="#n02">2</a>
                     Meanwhile, having appeared in a film version of Sayonara (directed by Koji Fukada), <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid
                           F</span></a> was nominated for the best actress award at the Tokyo
                     International Film Festival in 2015.
                     Even if the android did not ultimately win, the nomination indicates an effective performance of
                     its character.
                     Birnbaum et al. observe that people are generally willing to play along with the illusion that the
                     robot ‘is a sentient creature appropriate for relational interactions’ <a class="biblioRef"
                        href="#b01">1</a>.
                     Citing Sherry Turkle (2007), they report that people ‘are often willing to ignore the mechanical
                     aspects of the robot and to treat it in a manner similar to how they would respond to a fellow
                     human being’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a>.</p>
               <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s Three Sisters, the characters of android and human Ikumi are
                  foregrounded in their juxtaposition.
                  Cast in comparative terms—indeed, on one occasion, the two figures are literally positioned side by
                  side on stage—the collocation of android and human both exposes and disguises the distinctiveness of
                  their species forms.
                  In the process, audiences are invited to examine and compare the forms of the human and android
                  figures in light of their responses to these forms.
                  In the process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s stage play interrogates the role that species form plays in
                  positioning audience responses in terms of positive or negative shinwakan.</p>
               <p>In the first place, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s presentation of human and android Ikumi side by side is
                  notable for indicating that uncanniness may not necessarily connect exclusively or, even, primarily to
                  artificial humanlike entities.
                  Lin observes that,</p>
               <blockquote>
                  When Ikumi first appears suddenly with an expressionless face onstage, a feeling of uncanniness—toward
                  the human Ikumi, not the geminoid IKUMI—arises.
                  The similarity of movements and sound of the two turns the idea of the uncanny valley upside down. <a
                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>
               </blockquote>
               <p>The uncanniness arises from the abruptness and strangeness of human Ikumi’s appearance alongside her
                  android doppelgänger.
                  The story has taught us, up to this point, that human Ikumi is dead so when she appears, we don't know
                  how to place her and we don’t know how to place her.
                  The two Ikumis are almost indistinguishable in appearance terms. As Lin observes, their faces are
                  similarly expressionless but, more than this, they are of a similar physical size, they wear their
                  hair the same way, are dressed the same, and are likewise more or less motionless on stage (although
                  human Ikumi walks whereas the android character drives herself in her wheelchair).
                  Lin reports that, ‘(a)ccording to an anthropologist who attended as a member of the audience [of Three
                  Sisters]’, the feeling of eeriness arises in response to the puzzle: ‘who is the real daughter’? (Lin
                  quoting Feng <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>).
                  When human Ikumi first appears and the two figures appear onstage together, looking so similar, we
                  are, for a moment, doubtful about how to categorise them and during that moment, human Ikumi
                  paradoxically appears to be one thing and another: familiar and abruptly foreign.
                  Is human Ikumi real or is she another android or something else?</p>
               <p>Another important feature of the performances of android and human Ikumi are the ways in which their
                  species forms and roles are foregrounded in the performance, and the implications of these for their
                  likeability.
                  They are both quiet and thoughtful, with a tendency to be abrupt, which sometimes topples over into
                  rudeness. However, android Ikumi repeatedly reminds us that, unlike her human original, she has no
                  knowledge of death; she can smell but she cannot eat; she cannot lie; and she cannot forget.
                  This may be significant in terms of her likeability, given <span class="person">Schwind</span> et
                  al.’s findings that ‘the positive impression of a realistic animal is lost if it represents something
                  other than itself’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid
                        F</span></a>’s performance also marks out her species differences by virtue
                  of her mechanical acting, which, compared to her human counterpart’s performance, lacks fluency and
                  spontaneity.
                  Also, seen up close, one can detect the vacancy behind the robot’s eyes. Despite an apparent
                  expression of emotion in the form of a gentle smile, there is no spark of life or mind behind the
                  smile to lend it urgency or purpose.
                  The smile is no more than a signifier. One would expect such species differences—some of which reveal
                  themselves, in terms of acting, as flaws—to manifest negative audience responses towards the android.
                  However, the opposite is true: faced with the android-human juxtaposition, it is android Ikumi who
                  materializes as the more likeable character. According to <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s theory,
                  this should not be possible: one should not be able to feel greater empathy for an android than a
                  human, particularly one whose performance of human likeness is flawed, occasionally jarringly so.
                  So how does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a> manage to direct an audience to such a positive, even
                  empathetic, response for an android?
               </p>
               <p>The answer lies with quality of character and the geminoid’s performance of a sociable role.
                  She appears sociable, warm, and responsive: she sits with her family and guests and partakes in
                  conversations with them, seeming to demonstrate a high level of understanding of human needs and
                  feelings; her voice is soft in tone and predictable in its modulations; and her turns of the head and
                  range of expressions, including smiles, are sensitively choreographed by <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a> to indicate the android’s conscious and thoughtful attention to
                  the human characters in the scene.
                  Such performative elements, combined with details of her appearance, mean that this physically
                  attractive, woman-like, twenty-something android, demonstrating a sophisticated AI, conjures a quality
                  of character that is intelligent, attractive, gentle, direct, calm, honest, compassionate, and,
                  crucially, sociable.
                  Indeed, of the two, it is human, not android Ikumi, who demonstrates qualities that might be deemed
                  machine-like: human Ikumi seems comparatively cold, is frequently dissatisfied, less eager to please,
                  and her voice has a harder, flatter quality to it.
                  Human Ikumi’s uncanniness may also connect to these qualities. Gray and Wegner observe that humans
                  ‘incapable of fear or love’ are unnerving and that ‘the uncanny valley may apply to… robotic humans’
                  as well as humanlike robots <a class="biblioRef" href="#b08">8</a>.</p>
               <p>Human Ikumi is the biological sister in the Fukazawa family but she does not perform the role in the
                  sorts of ways we expect of, or culturally value in, a sibling.
                  It is android Ikumi whose performance of a sister finds a more imaginatively and emotionally
                  compelling form: she takes an interest in her elder sisters and brother and participates in the
                  activities and concerns of the household with apparent selflessness and compassion.
                  Android Ikumi is positioned in performative terms as kin to the Fukazawa siblings and in the process,
                  she prompts the sisters (and her audiences) to experience positive shinwakan for her, a sense of
                  synchronicity, a sense that she, despite her form as android, is friendly towards them, that she
                  understands and likes them in a way that the real Ikumi appears not to.
                  The fact that android Ikumi is not really Ikumi appears to matter less to these sisters (and, by
                  implication, the audience) than her performance of the role of sister, which materialises in an
                  idealized and friendly form.</p>
               <p>In this example, we see a demonstration of the significance of dramatic character.
                  The imaginary (character) and the real (performer) are fused into a singly perceived, dialectical
                  phenomenon.</p>
               <p>Some interesting questions arise from the representation of android Ikumi in <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s Three Sisters that engage with questions about the design and
                  programming of sociable robots.
                  How far might sociability be important to producing positive, as opposed to negative, shinwakan?
                  (Negative shinwakan, here, does not necessarily refer to uncanniness but more generally to a lack of
                  synchrony or kinship.) How far might predictability be important in positioning a performer as kin and
                  eliciting positive shinwakan, or its converse, bukimi, i.e. eeriness (in the event that predictability
                  corresponds with perceived threat)?
                  Can an unsociable character, human or android, inspire positive feelings of kinship in audiences?
                  Might my own cool feelings towards human Ikumi derive from her machinelike character qualities?
                  Or might my response derive from the perceived contradictions in her form and performance and in her
                  character role and character actions?</p>

               <h3>Aesthetics, Genre, and Character Coherence</h3>
               <hr>
               <h2>Aesthetics: A Better Term Than Attractiveness</h2>
               <p>A study by <span class="person">Schwind</span>, Leicht, Jäger, Wolf, and <span
                     class="person">Henze</span> asks the question: ‘Is there an uncanny valley of virtual animals?’ <a
                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>
                  Focusing on animated representations of cats in a variety of computer games, the study does something
                  important: it substitutes attractiveness for aesthetics, explaining the substitution by way of its
                  focus on animal-like objects rather than human-like ones.</p>
               <p>Aesthetics is much richer terrain than attractiveness, which is subsumed by the broader category of
                  the former. Aesthetics is the study of subjective and sensori-emotional values relating to art and
                  beauty.
                  As a branch of philosophy, it asks questions about the judgement of sentiment and taste and
                  investigates how and why we find some things beautiful and not others.
                  Aesthetics engages with ways in which artists imagine, create, and perform works of art as well as
                  indicating styles and principles for a given genre of art (for example, distinguishing between the
                  Impressionist versus Cubist aesthetic).
                  In their study, <span class="person">Schwind</span> et al. are interested in subjective and
                  sensori-emotional values attaching to the representations of the cats as well as the coherency of the
                  cats’ representational categories, styles, and principles as they find form in their various
                  animations.</p>
               <h2>How the Significance of Realism Expands Beyond Degrees-Of-Realism</h2>
               <p>In a point that engages with aesthetics, <span class="person">Schwind</span> et al. identify problems
                  with ‘(t)he manipulation of realism’ in uncanny valley studies.
                  The concept of realism, <span class="person">Schwind</span> et al. note, can be compromised because it
                  is ‘partially biased by other associations’ <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  This is an important observation because it starts to recognise the nuanced implications of realism,
                  which extend beyond degrees-of-realism.</p>
               <p>Realism indicates a representational form in artistic fields, including theatre, that connects to a
                  distinct set of logics and styles.
                  For example, realism offers a positivist representation of the world that follows the laws of cause
                  and effect.
                  You don’t get demons, ghosts, monsters, or talking scarecrows in realistic theatre. (Such entities
                  belong in, for example, surrealism, which operates at the level of the dream and, as such, refuses the
                  logic of everyday life, adopting a more abstract and poetic style of representation.)
                  Realism is distinctive from other forms—such as expressionism or surrealism—by virtue of its
                  objectivity, its focus on appearance (on what is said, how things look and sound, how people relate to
                  each other), as well as its implicit assumptions about people.
                  In realism, people are understood to be fundamentally psychological individuals who are intelligent
                  and capable of reasoned behaviours as they set about pursuing their goals by applying a variety of
                  tactics and actions within recognisable social contexts.<a class="noteRef" href="#n03">3</a>
                  This conception of realism is, broadly, analogous with its meaning in uncanny valley studies, which,
                  focusing on human likeness, targets appearance, and assumes a way of human being that is social,
                  intelligent, and self-determining.</p>
               <p>However, realism is complicated by the fact that it is categorised and structured by genre.
                  Examples of genres include social realism, Epic Theatre, kitchen-sink drama, comedies (farce, satire,
                  parody), tragedy, tragi-comedies, science fiction, dystopian dramas, detective dramas, romantic
                  dramas, melodrama, verbatim drama, and so on.
                  This is significant because the specific forms of stories in which realistic characters are cast
                  function to clarify their roles, i.e. what those characters do and how they relate to society, at the
                  same time as they influence audience expectations about those characters.</p>
               <p>Consider the character of a male police officer. This character may be performed realistically by a
                  single actor in a number of different dramatic genres and each time, the audience will engage with him
                  differently, sometimes liking him, sometimes fearing him, sometimes rooting for him, and so on.
                  In a comedy, the police officer figure is commonly depicted as a figure of fun or ridicule whereas,
                  cast in a detective drama, he may feature as the hero of the drama, acting to protect the innocent.
                  In a dystopian drama, the police officer may be one of the villains whereas in a television soap, he
                  may be the object of our curiosity and sympathy as we watch him struggle to juggle work and home
                  demands.</p>
               <p>If a director were casting a single actor for the figure of a police officer in a farce, she may
                  require him to grow a moustache, appear bald, use make-up to redden his nose, and ask him to smile
                  inappropriately at everything—anything to contribute to the sense that this figure is to be ridiculed.
                  If this same actor were to be cast as a police officer in a dystopian drama, he may be given slicked
                  back hair, eyebrows that rise at the edges, and be required to wear a serious and sombre demeanour,
                  facially and physically, at all times.</p>
               <p>The key point, here, is that when we engage with a realistic figure, we look for clues to know how to
                  interpret and categorise that figure according to genre.
                  If we see a face sporting a serious expression, with eyebrows that are raised at the outer edges, we
                  are likely to draw upon common cultural narratives categorising that character as, say, a villain.</p>
               <h2>How Character Impacts Upon the Likeability of Artificial Humanlike Objects</h2>
               <p>This notion of aesthetic character coherence is revealing when held up against studies presenting a
                  face on a continuum of realism to test how people respond to human versus animated or cartoon
                  abstractions.
                  A number of such studies have produced results that contradict <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s, or
                  refined versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s theory.
                  Some of these contradictions arise not because the theories are wrong but because insufficient
                  attention has been paid to the characteristics of the figures represented or to their forms of
                  representation, where such information indicates particular character types and sets up corresponding
                  audience expectations, which connect to likeability and uncanniness.</p>
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C5%ABki_Yamada" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Yamada</span></a> et al.’s study <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a> seeks to
                  demonstrate the validity of their hypothesis that ‘the uncanny valley phenomenon is determined not by
                  the visual similarity to a real human, but the categorization difficulty for an object’.
                  Their results are ambiguous with participant responses showing that ‘the images that were difficult to
                  categorize were not always negatively evaluated’.
                  For example, the highest likeability score for Experiment 3 went to the most ambiguous facial
                  categorisation (see the middle face of the bottom line of faces in Fig. 3).
                  Meanwhile, results attaching to Experiments 1 and 2 show that the highest likeability scores were
                  attributed to the stuffed human (see the figure on the far right of the top line of faces in Fig. 3)
                  and the cartoon dog (see the figure on the far left of the second line of faces in Fig. 3).
                  The authors propose that attractiveness may be a factor in these results. This is possible. However,
                  other reasons for these likeability scores are character type and character coherence.</p>

                  </figcaption>
               </figure>
               <p>The real human male face in Experiment 1 (see the top line of images in Fig. 3) is placed at one end
                  of a scale of human likeness and a ‘stuffed human’ appears at the other end.
                  What is key, here, is that the stuffed human is not a generic figure (even assuming such a figure is
                  feasible); it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brown" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Charlie Brown</span></a>.
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brown" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Charlie
                        Brown</span></a> is a well-known and well-loved cartoon character in the

                        class="entity">Peanuts</span></a>. Assuming the study participants are familiar with
                  this comic strip, it is unsurprising that the character of <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Brown" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Charlie
                        Brown</span></a>
                  is more likeable than the real human who looks very nice but whose character is not so immediately
                  identifiable.
               </p>
               <p>In Experiment 2, the likeability of the cartoon dog was found to be higher than both the stuffed dog
                  (see Fig. 3, second line of images from the top; the cartoon dog appears far left and the stuffed dog
                  appears far right) and the real dog (see the bottom row of images of dogs in Fig. 3; the real dog is
                  at the far left).
                  The cartoon dog is, of course, <span class="entity">Snoopy</span>, another well-known and well-loved
                  character from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Peanuts</span></a>.
                  Again, given its character form, this figure’s likeability is predictable. Finally, the remarkable
                  results of Experiment 3 (see the bottom row of images of dogs in Fig. 3; the real dog is at the far
                  left) are that the lowest likeability score corresponds with the real male face, which is at the far
                  left of the series of morphed images, and the greatest likeability is scored by the face with the
                  greatest category ambiguity (the middle face on the bottom row of images).
                  This becomes less puzzling if you consider that the least likeable male figure on the bottom row (far
                  left) is wearing a very serious expression and has slightly pointed eyebrows, a feature that casting
                  directors would exploit; as already indicated, in a film, this figure might be cast as a villain.</p>

               <p>The authors state that the results of their study ‘clearly showed that viewers found the whole
                  continuum positively acceptable’.
                  They continue: ‘The reaction never dipped into the negative region, (and) thus showed no sign of the

                  make her likeable, whatever form she takes, be this animated or real.
                  In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_(Disney_character)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Princess Jasmine</span></a> is at her most likeable, according to the study
                  results, in the first two images where she is depicted as an animation.
                  Despite the fact this contradicts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s hypothesis, this should be no
                  surprise, given that this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine_(Disney_character)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="entity">Princess Jasmine</span></a>’s authentic form.
                  The human version of her (see the far right of Fig. 4) is an ‘artificial’ representation, just as

               <p>Having considered ways in which highly characterful figures influence studies testing for likeability,
                  let us now consider the implications of an object devoid of character.
                  <span class="person">Kriz</span> et al.’s study <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a> inquires into
                  how people’s attitudes to robots connect to their expectations about robots.
                  Notably, the authors recognise the influential status of cultural depictions of robots in relation to
                  people’s expectations about them: their study results suggest, overall, that expectations about the
                  ‘robot’s cognitive and social capabilities are highly correlated with how a wide variety of robots are
                  depicted in fictional films’.
                  However, certain capabilities, such as aggression, though common in fictional robots, scored low
                  likelihood ratings in their survey, a finding that understandably surprised the authors.
               </p>
               <p>This finding becomes less surprising when one considers the appearance of the <span
                     class="entity">PeopleBot</span> used in their study (see Fig. 5).
                  The robot looks a bit like a narrow treadmill frame, with two ‘legs’ positioned underneath a console
                  comprising a tablet featuring the face of a white male, possibly in his late twenties or thirties,
                  sporting a serious expression (although it is difficult to tell as the image is indistinct).
                  Given that <span class="entity">PeopleBot</span> lacks arms, legs, or anything that might function as
                  a weapon, it is unsurprising that respondents did not automatically conceive of the machine in
                  aggressive terms.
                  It would be a stretch to imagine the robot doing any damage to anything. In this sense, <span
                     class="person">Kriz</span> et al. are correct when they surmise that ‘suspension of disbelief is
                  finite’.
                  Audiences need a sufficient and appropriate set of physical cues to inspire imaginative responses,
                  which animate and anthropomorphise robots.
                  <span class="entity">PeopleBot</span>, which is not at all humanlike, is hard to imagine possessing
                  any kind of psychology or character.
                  It is evidently a telepresence robot and, as such, its ‘body’ is a neutral platform for someone to
                  ‘bring to life’ virtually.

               <h3>Some Reflections on the Uncanny</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>In their study on the importance of predictive mechanisms in perceptions of artificial human forms,
                  Urgen et al. suggest that ‘incongruence between an object’s appearance and
                  motion’ can give rise to uncanny responses <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  The authors write that the ‘uncanny valley could be explained by violation of one’s predictions about
                  human norms when encountered with realistic but artificial human forms’.
                  This is to say, from an object’s form, we infer how it will move (and, in the terms of this paper, how
                  it will speak, act, and interact), and if these expectations are violated, we experience an uncanny
                  response.</p>
               <p>Urgen et al. explain:</p>
               <blockquote>
                  According to predictive coding, the uncanny valley is related to violation of expectations in neural
                  computing when the brain encounters almost-but-not-quite-human agents.
                  A growing body of work has associated <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s hypothetical curve to the
                  processing of conflicting perceptual or cognitive cues, in which the stimuli are compatible with the
                  elicited expectations or are in violation of them. <a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>
               </blockquote>
               <p>While the case is compelling—that our engagements with objects in the world are significantly
                  cognitive, arising from experience and familiarity, and that incongruence between (character)
                  expectations and behaviours may be bound up in uncanny responses—incongruence alone seems an
                  insufficient cause for uncanniness.
                  Incongruent character features, such as may arise between appearance, movements, and actions, can, for
                  example, have comic effects.
                  To evoke uncanniness, something more seems necessary, something pertaining to the form and quality of
                  the incongruence, which, most likely, corresponds with a potential threat.</p>
               <p>Certain objects seem to predispose audiences to uncanny responses through the ways in which they
                  indicate particular types of narrative and audience engagement.
                  Consider the figures of clowns and dolls as well as poltergeists and zombies, figures that explicitly
                  indicate supernatural thrillers and horror films.</p>
               <p>If, as this paper has already argued, humanlike artificial objects at the positive end of the
                  shinwakan scale belong there because of their character forms and qualities, then objects appearing at
                  the negative end must belong there because of their subverted character forms and qualities.
                  If objects produce positive audience responses because they appear to be conscious, psychologically
                  coherent characters that are friendly, familiar, and sociable (i.e. these objects appear to understand
                  and like or love us), then objects at the negative end of the axis are likely to be psychologically
                  incoherent, mysterious, irrational, or ambivalent, as well as strangely familiar;<a class="noteRef"
                     href="#n04">4</a>
                  and their social status as ‘friend’ must be insecure (i.e. they appear not to understand or love or
                  like us and, uncertain of their motivations, we sense that they may mean to do us harm).</p>
               <p><span class="person">Bruce Mangan</span>, writing about the uncanny experience as fringe experience <a
                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>, observes that it seems ‘to involve a rare and complex mix of
                  familiarity, wrongness, and a feeling of threat’.
                  Anxieties may also arise, in a related way, from the discomfort of having to cognitively re-orientate
                  ourselves in relation to a world that, while being semiotically familiar, appears phenomenally and
                  simultaneously strange and unaccountable.
                  Things are not as they seem. Consider <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s discussion of the realistic
                  prosthetic hand.
                  He suggests that the experience of shaking such a hand, which, at first sight, looks real, produces an
                  eerie sensation because of its ‘limp boneless grip together with its texture and coldness’ <a
                     class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>.
                  When we shake a realistic prosthetic hand, says <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>, ‘we lose our sense
                  of affinity, and the hand becomes uncanny’.</p>
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s example of the prosthetic hand is revealing and resonates with
                  an
                  uncanny moment I experienced watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1"
                     target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a>’s performance in another
                  one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Hirata</span></a>’s plays, Sayonara (2010) <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a>.
                  In this play, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a> is cast in the role of companion to a young woman
                  who is dying. There is a moment in the performance when the human actress takes the hand of the
                  android and holds it to her cheek, implicitly expressing her desire to be physically comforted.(This
                  is the moment shown in Fig. 2.)
                  This particular action prompted a wave of distaste in me. Imaginatively identifying with the human
                  character in the scene at an affective, embodied level, I intuited that the hand of the android would
                  feel hard and lifeless or, to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s terminology, ‘limp’ and
                  ‘boneless’.
                  Also, it was evident that the robot did not return the young human woman’s grip of its hand.
                  This momentarily jolted me out of my anthropomorphic assumption that the robot is (human) like me.
                  While maintaining imaginative engagement with this robot performer as a sophisticated android, I
                  became abruptly and affectively aware that however humanlike this android appears, it remains
                  ontologically and phenomenologically distinct: it is not flesh and blood, it will not die, and it does
                  not feel.
                  Its absence of living warmth seems suddenly distasteful, its hand evocative of that of a corpse; its
                  relationship with time comes into view as something vastly different to human time, a difference that
                  is strange and uncomfortable; and its incapacity to empathise with humans becomes abruptly and
                  distastefully apparent.</p>
               <p>Touch, whether real or imagined, may strongly stimulate responses to humanoid robots, perhaps because
                  it moves us from reading the object semiotically to grasping it affectively. Rather than studying the
                  object from a distance, we engage with it sensuously, and respond to it at a more involuntary level.
                  Certainly, my own experience of meeting <span class="entity">Pepper</span> at <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Museum,_London" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">the
                        Science Museum</span></a> for its ‘Robots’ exhibition <a class="noteRef" href="#n05">5</a>
                  indicates as
                  much.
                  The robot invited me to give it a fist bump. I had to perform the fist-bump with a degree of
                  surprising robustness, then, pulling away, the robot wiggled its fingers at me.
                  Without thought or hesitation, I copied it. This moment brought the interaction to life. For this
                  moment, I stopped perceiving the robot as something to study and marvel at and switched into an
                  automatic mode of social engagement.
                  The interaction moved from a performance to something that felt real. Knight may be correct in
                  identifying ‘full body gestures’ as being important
                  for tapping ‘into our emotional experience in a uniquely human way’ <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a>, but there is something about touch that may be particularly marked.</p>

               <h3>Conclusion</h3>
               <hr>
               <p>Drawing upon stage plays, theories of theatre and narrative studies, and robotics research, including
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s theory of the uncanny valley, this paper has identified,
                  explored,
                  and interrogated elements important to the effective performance of likeable sociable humanoid robots.
                  In particular, it has engaged with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s reference to total appearance
                  and considered how it might be useful to robotics researchers.
                  It has articulated ways in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s notion of total appearance
                  connects to realism in creating likeable sociable robots.
                  And it has argued that theatre, including its elements of performance, aesthetics, character, and
                  genre, can be employed to bring to light features of robotics research influential in the creation of
                  humanlike objects that are likeable as opposed to uncanny.
               </p>
               <p>This paper’s key propositions and conclusions are that theatre can contribute much to the study and
                  design of sociable robots, particularly in relation to understanding the importance of total
                  appearance and character in the performance of likeable robots.
                  Theatre also offers a lively and socially complex laboratory to explore compelling ‘what if?’
                  scenarios between human and robot characters.</p>
               <p>The sociable robot is inherently a performer and needs to be engaged with as such.
                  The humanoid robot is performative, i.e. it establishes its identity and role through the totality of
                  its performance to a human audience or interacting person.</p>
               <p>Theatre-makers, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriza_Hirata"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Hirata</span></a> and his play, <span class="entity">Three
                     Sisters: Android Version</span>, show how character is a powerful element that can compensate for
                  flaws in the physical performance of human likeness by robots.
                  These performances, in combination with <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a>’s concept of shinwakan,
                  indicate that kinship is almost certainly vital if artificial objects such as humanoid robots are to
                  prompt positive (or negative) shinwakan in interacting humans.</p>
               <p>This paper, drawing upon stage performances and robotics studies, has argued the importance of
                  creating or representing aesthetically coherent representations of character, where all the parts of
                  character coalesce to produce a socially identifiable figure whose behaviours are predictable.
                  While uncanny responses to objects may arise because those objects appear both too humanlike but not
                  humanlike enough, or else because of category uncertainty, this paper has attempted to show that
                  details of character, including character incoherence, are also likely causes of degrees of
                  likeability.
                  Further, this paper has suggested that for a robot to be likeable, it may need to avoid pretending to
                  be anything other than itself, a robot, however humanlike in appearance it may be.
                  Acknowledgement of its distinct species form may be important.</p>
               <p>This paper has argued that audiences observe stage figures and worlds with binocular vision.
                  When they observe agents—human or otherwise—engaged in behaviours, they conjoin real and imagined
                  elements to create a total impression of the performing object.
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)" target="_blank"><span
                        class="person">Mori</span></a> himself refers to such a tendency when he describes how audiences
                  respond to the total appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku" target="_blank"><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunraku" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Bunraku
                           puppet</span></a></a>s.
               </p>
               <p>This paper suggests that binocular vision carries over into real life.
                  Just as we read the subtext of characters performed by actors in a naturalistic play, so we read the
                  clues available to us from the performances of people or sociable robots in the world and we infer and
                  imagine the rest.
                  Our engagement with a real object, be this object human or robot, is equally reliant upon a binocular
                  and dialectical structure, which depends upon the active, imaginative participation of audiences.
                  Real-life performance is different to staged performance not because it operates in the realm of
                  empirical certainty as opposed to imaginative belief, but because it is really happening in the
                  ongoing, improvised present and its stakes are real, not purely performative, as they generally are on
                  the stage.</p>
               <p>HRI research can exploit this capacity of humans to respond to performing objects both cognitively and
                  affectively by attending more carefully to the total impression their artificial objects create
                  through their physical appearance (including all features indicative of specific identity types and
                  social/narrative roles),
                  use of language, voice, gestures, types and qualities of actions, spatial positioning, quality and
                  speed of speech and movement, as well as touch.</p>
               <p>This paper, building on the work of <span class="person">Schwind</span> et al. <a class="biblioRef"
                     href="#b14">14</a>, argues that realism may be a broader and more subtle category than is suggested
                  by degrees-of-realism of appearance.
                  In the first place, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s account of matters, the realism of some
                  elements of appearance and context can offset or compensate for others that are less-than-realistic.
                  In the second place, the concept of realism is complicated by the fact that it is sub-categorised and
                  structured by genre.
                  Observers attend to the total appearance of humanlike figures and, from these, they identify character
                  type and role, i.e. what those characters do and how they relate to society.
                  From such identification, the robot’s behaviours become, crucially, predictable.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a> recognizes, total appearance trumps realism of
                  humanlike appearance for the promotion of positive shinwakan, a position corroborated by this paper’s
                  analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span
                        class="entity">Geminoid F</span></a>’s performance in <span class="entity">Three
                     Sisters: Android Version</span>.
                  Analysis of this play also indicates, by means of juxtaposing <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telenoid_R1" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Geminoid

                  with her human counterpart, that species affinity is less important than character type and quality
                  for the recognition of kinship.
                  For positive shinwakan to be experienced, the interacting human needs to recognize in the object (or
                  other human) a consciousness and character that bears some affinity with the human and appears to be
                  friendly.
                  A sociable and emotionally generous character seems much more likely to prompt feelings of kinship
                  than an unsociable and emotionally close character, irrespective of species.</p>
               <p>This paper argues that the uncanny is not an inherent quality of an artificial object.
                  The uncanny is a quality of sensation arising from the interaction of a human with another human or
                  object, with which it shares kinship of some kind but which appears to be ontologically other, or be
                  operating at an inhuman level, such that it cannot be known or understood by the human.
                  In the gap, the human imagination opens up to notions of the unknowable or, possibly, the
                  supernatural.</p>
               <p>As we come increasingly to share the human world with robots, and as sections of human society come to
                  be cared for by them, the forms these robots take will be important to their effectiveness as social
                  entities.
                  If we are to enjoy friendly, trusting, and enjoyable relations with robots, they will need to be
                  characterized in thoughtful ways, which correspond not only with the roles they are intended to play
                  (as carers, shop assistants, instructors, medical assistants, and so on) but also with the identities
                  of their intended interacting humans.</p>
               <p class="footer">As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Mori_(roboticist)"
                     target="_blank"><span class="person">Mori</span></a>’s own paper indicates, research in the field
                  of HRI
                  might really effectively draw upon theatre’s artful placement and performance of humans, puppets, and
                  objects in order to make relatively simple robots appear as likeable kin, capable of engendering real
                  feelings of warmth and friendship in their interactions with humans.
                  Just as fictional events on stage generate real absorption and real feelings of sadness or fear or
                  happiness in audiences, so robots can be contextualized and constructed to appear, in the totality of
                  their performances, as coherent and conscious characters, be their characters humanlike, animal-like,
                  or something else.
                  Properly cast, characterized, and scripted, robots—even relatively simple ones—can generate shinwakan
                  in the humans with which they interact in social roles.</p>

                  being important to game designers. It is also important to humanoid robot designers. Chemers observes
                  how ‘humans are quite prone to perceive computer intelligences as possessing far greater depth,
                  complexity, and emotional content than they possibly could’. He also observes that the kind of
                  cognitive dissonance bound to the Eliza effect is the sort ‘that theatre artists from all ages have
                  sought to foster; it, or something like it, is what Coleridge called “suspension of disbelief.”’.</p>
               <p class="noteItem" id="n02"><span class="noteMarker">2.</span>Additional evidence of audience empathy
                  for Hirata’s stage robots is provided in the form of survey results responding to another of Hirata’s
                  android performances, I, Worker, which features Mitsubishi’s Wakamaru robot. The two Wakamaru robots
                  in this play are not as humanlike as the Geminoid F in Three Sisters, nor are their characters
                  conceived as being as sociable or sophisticated as the character performed by the Geminoid F. However,
                  Lin reports that their treatment by Hirata as sociable worker robots elicited empathetic responses
                  from audience members. Quoting Kuroki (2010), Lin writes that a survey responding to a performance of
                  I, Worker on 25 November 2008 revealed that ‘70 percent of the audience reported either feeling or
                  moderately feeling empathy for the robots’.</p>
