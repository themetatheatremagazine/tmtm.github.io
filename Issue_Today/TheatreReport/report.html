      <h4>Executive Summary – Key Findings</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The immediate and ongoing impact on the performing arts of the COVID-19 lockdown fell
            more in the <span class="place">U.K.</span> than in <span class="place">North America</span>.</li>
        <li>In <span class="place">North America</span>, comparative annual ticket sales collapsed by 71% during the week of
            March 16, 2020 and have not recovered.</li>
        <li>In the same week, <span class="place">U.K.</span> sales fell by 87% and then by 94% the following week.</li>
        <li><span class="place">U.K.</span> sales remain flat, but the gap between the <span class="place">U.K.</span> and <span class="place">North America</span> is shrinking as
            there is no sign yet of recovery in the <span class="place">North America</span>n market, despite the accelerated
            release of lockdowns in many states.</li>
        <li>In <span class="place">North America</span>, the largest and smallest organizations are seeing sales decline most in a
            challenging market for all.</li>
        <li>In the <span class="place">U.K.</span>, larger organizations are marginally outperforming smaller ones in an extremely
            difficult market.</li>
        <li>A higher proportion of smaller <span class="place">U.K.</span> organizations are choosing to shut their box offices for
            all sales.</li>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p class="capital"><span class="entity">TRG Arts</span> and <span class="entity">Purple Seven</span> have partnered to provide real-time intelligence and advice to the arts and cultural sector on the economic impact of COVID-19 and how best to respond to it.
         This partnership brings together <span class="entity">Purple Seven</span>’s experience of live sales feeds from hundreds of arts venues and <span class="entity">TRG Arts</span>’ consulting and data analysis expertise in achieving unsurpassed results for the arts and cultural sector.</p>
      <p>In the <span class="place">United States</span>, <span class="place">Canada</span>, the <span class="place">United Kingdom</span> and the <span class="place">Republic of Ireland</span>, cultural organizations are invited to sign up to a free and easy to use international COVID-19 Sector Benchmark Dashboard.
         An automated data feed between the organization’s box office and <span class="entity">Purple Seven</span>’s secure servers provides a daily update on ticket sales, refunds and donations which is anonymized and aggregated for the national benchmark.</p>
      <p><span class="entity">TRG Arts</span> and <span class="entity">Purple Seven</span> intend to share new findings from the national benchmarks on a frequent basis during the crisis.
         This initial study focuses on the comparative impact of COVID-19 on ticket sales in <span class="place">North America</span> and the <span class="place">U.K.</span> from January to May 2020.</p>

    <section id="The two cohorts">
      <h4>The two cohorts</h4>
      <p>In <span class="place">North America</span>, feeds are currently being taken from 52 systems.
         In <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, they collectively generated over $450 million in box office revenue.
         The cohort is a mixture of commercial and not for profit organizations.
         Geographically, participating organizations come from all over the <span class="place">U.S.</span> and there are four organizations currently contributing from <span class="place">Canada</span>.
         The majority of the sample are theaters, but there is also a good representation of arts centers and orchestras.
         The size and scale of organizations is diverse with as many organizations with revenues in <time datetime="2019">2019</time> below $1 million as those above $10 million.</p>

       	 </figcaption>
       	 </figure>
      <p>In the <span class="place">U.K.</span> there are feeds from 196 systems that have data for the entirety of <time datetime="2019">2019</time> and <time datetime="2020">2020</time> to date<a class="noteRef" href="#n01">1</a>.
         In <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, they collectively generated over £866 million (US $1.1 billion) in box office revenue.</p>
      <p>The cohort is a mixture of commercial and not for profit organizations.
         Geographically, participating organizations come from all over the <span class="place">U.K.</span> and there are multiple organizations from every nation and region.
         Several West End venues are included. The majority of the sample are theaters, but there is also a good representation of concert halls and arts centers.
         The size and scale of organizations is diverse with a higher proportion of small organizations.</p>

      <p>February was also a good month in <span class="place">North America</span>, with revenues up 2% and ticket sales up 11% compared to the same period last year.</p>
      <p>After a good start to the month, sales and revenues dropped considerably in the second half of February in the <span class="place">U.K.</span> compared to <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, but this was due to the final week of sales in February <time datetime="2019">2019</time> being particularly strong.
         In <time datetime="2020">2020</time>, weekly sales and revenues continued to increase.</p>
      <p>Across the entire nine-week period, compared to <time datetime="2019">2019</time> the <span class="place">North America</span>n cohort saw sales rise by 3% and revenues increase by 8% while the <span class="place">U.K.</span> saw a 7% drop in sales and 9% in revenues.</p>

      <p>In the <span class="place">U.K.</span> for the first two weeks of March <time datetime="2020">2020</time> aggregate ticket sales were down by over 25% compared to the equivalent weeks in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>.
         Reductions in revenue were greater, meaning that the average price paid for tickets dropped.</p>

      <p>The <span class="place">U.K.</span> Benchmark has been consistently outperformed by the North American cohort over the last eight weeks, but the gap is swiftly narrowing:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While measures to release the lockdowns progress at regionally different paces in both <span class="place">North America</span> and the <span class="place">U.K.</span>, generally <span class="place">Canada</span> and the <span class="place">U.S.</span> are ahead of the <span class="place">U.K.</span>
         We might therefore expect an upturn in bookings for future performances in <span class="place">North America</span>, but the current trendline is descending.</p>
      <p>Initial analysis from <span class="entity">TRG Arts</span> and <span class="entity">Purple Seven</span> suggests that a higher proportion of tickets in <time datetime="2020">2020</time> are being purchased by ”loyalists” and that on average North American audiences have higher proportions of ”loyal” audience segments<a class="noteRef" href="#n02">2</a>.
         The trendline suggests that North American organizations may now be exhausting that pool of more loyal audiences and is not seeing confidence return from other segments.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Digging Deeper">
      <h4>Digging Deeper – organizations bucking the trend</h4>
      <p>Taking a closer look at the data for the last three complete weeks (May 4-24) reveals that organizations in <span class="place">North America</span> are performing very differently in a challenging market.</p>
      <p>Segmenting the participating organizations by total <time datetime="2019">2019</time> ticket revenue shows that on an aggregate basis those North American organizations with the highest and lowest annual box office income in <time datetime="2019">2019</time> were performing less well than the rest of the benchmark<a class="noteRef" href="#n03">3</a>.</p>
      <figure id="f10">
         <img src="Issue_Today/TheatreReport/images/image_11.png" alt="North America Revenue and Tickets">
       </figure>
      <p>This diversity between segments is also mirrored within them.
         In the segments with lower ticketing revenue there are some organizations that appear to be outperforming their own figures for the equivalent three-week period in COVID-19-free <time datetime="2019">2019</time>.</p>
      <p>The <span class="place">U.K.</span> data tell a different story:</p>
      <figure id="f11">
         <img src="Issue_Today/TheatreReport/images/image_12.png" alt="United Kingdom Revenue and Tickets">
       </figure>
      <p>No organization in this much larger cohort got close to matching its revenues for <time datetime="2019">2019</time> during this three-week period and only two achieved more than 50%.</p>
      <p>It appears a far higher proportion of <span class="place">U.K.</span> organizations have taken the decision to remove all events from sale and shut their box offices.
         These include prominent organizations like <span class="entity">London’s Royal Court Theatre</span> and <span class="entity">Manchester’s Royal Exchange</span>.
         Of the sample, 37 <span class="place">U.K.</span> organizations sold no tickets during this three-week period.
         Thirty of these were organizations with a turnover of less than £1 million.
         Only four North American organizations did not register a sale.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Conclusion">
      <h4>Conclusions</h4>
      <p><span class="entity">TRG Arts</span> and <span class="entity">Purple Seven</span> are no better able than any other organization or individual to predict whether we are now emerging from a global pandemic or simply reaching the end of the first chapter of a longer and even more serious and destructive phase.</p>
      <p>This initial analysis was undertaken to answer the question, “How are the <span class="place">U.K.</span> and the North American markets faring in the wake of COVID-19 and the temporary closure of performing arts venues?”</p>
      <p>We have seen that the response and behavior to date of performing arts organizations and their supporters have been very different in these two major international markets.
         In <span class="place">North America</span>, while most organizations have seen a catastrophic dip in sales, some have limited the immediate financial impact of COVID-19 by effectively engaging with their most loyal patrons and sustaining, and in some cases even increasing, sales for shows later in <time datetime="2020">2020</time>.</p>
      <p>In the <span class="place">U.K.</span> ticket sales and revenue fell earlier and further.
         Almost all organizations are selling a tiny fraction of the volumes of tickets they would expect at the current stage of the sales cycle.
         Around 15% have taken a proactive decision to stop selling tickets until they have greater clarity on reopening dates and arrangements.</p>
      <p>Despite being ahead of the <span class="place">U.K.</span> in the process of releasing lockdown and planning for the reopening of venues, in <span class="place">North America</span> customer confidence does not appear to be returning and comparative weekly sales continue to be in decline.</p>
      <p>Answering one question poses several further queries and hypotheses we plan to test in future reports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Who is booking and what are they purchasing?</strong> Initial analysis suggests “loyalists<a class="noteRef" href="#n04">4</a>” are a higher proportion of sales than we would usually expect in both the <span class="place">U.K.</span> and <span class="place">North America</span>.
            How much of the comparatively better sales in <span class="place">North America</span> are down to more loyal audiences?
            How important have subscription sales been for those organizations who are outperforming their peers?</li>
        <li><strong>Where are we seeing confidence returning?</strong> How far in advance are customers booking?
            Are sales where we would expect them to be for autumn/fall? How is the crucial holiday period performing in both markets?
            Are we still seeing extended families booking to attend together, or is group size reducing?</li>
        <li><strong>Is new philanthropic income replacing lost ticket income?</strong>
            Many performing arts organizations, particularly in the <span class="place">U.K.</span>, have taken a strategic decision to stop selling tickets and instead focus on encouraging donations from their patrons.
            Is this proving effective? Are organizations achieving record increases in philanthropic income at the same time as witnessing unprecedented falls in ticket sales?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="footer"><span class="entity">Purple Seven</span> and <span class="entity">TRG Arts</span> are still welcoming new organizations to join the free COVID-19 Sector Benchmark and would particularly like to welcome organizations in <span class="place">Canada</span> and the <span class="place">Republic of Ireland</span> to establish benchmarks in these nations.
