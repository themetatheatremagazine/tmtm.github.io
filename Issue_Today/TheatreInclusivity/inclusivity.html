            <h2>A discussion of inclusivity for young LGBT+ actors working today, with National Theatre casting
               assistant Jacob Sparrow</h2>
         </header>
         <article>
            <p class="capital">Pride month may be over, but the discussion on <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span class="entity">LGBT+</span></a>
               inclusivity and diversity in casting doesn’t end here.
               We caught up with <span class="person">Jacob Sparrow</span>, casting assistant at the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">National Theatre</span></a>, to discuss his top tips for young gay actors, the
               responsibility of theatre to kick-start cultural conversations, and the importance of diversity in the
               arts.</p>
            <blockquote>
               Be secure and happy in yourself. There will always be a social barrier until we fight to pull it down. If
               you're in a rehearsal or at an audition and someone says “play this gay character and flounce around,”
               ask why.
               Is that a character trait? Where does that come from? Or is that just trying to shove a gay character in
               without thinking about the implications of what it means?
            </blockquote>
            <h4>Theatre and the arts have often been seen as a safe space to explore sexuality and challenge convention.
               To what degree do you think this is still true?</h4>
            <p>Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span class="entity">LGBT</span></a>
               people find a safe space in theatre because it is an open and artistic community.
               The danger in making that assumption is to think, “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT"
                  target="_blank"><span class="entity">LGBT</span></a> people are represented and we don't need to do
               anything [more] about it.”
               If you look at the representation of gay men, for example, quite often the plays being produced are
               reinforcing negative stereotypes.
               There are a lot of plays around HIV and AIDS; a lot of contemporary plays around gay men on Grindr or
               resisting monogamy, and that is a part of our community that exists but, as a gay man, I really crave to
               see a wider representation.</p>
            <p>It's almost impossible to find representation of trans or bisexual people, and lesbian women are often
               narrowly represented in terms of stereotypes.
               Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">LGBT</span></a> people are only allowed to exist within an <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span class="entity">LGBT</span></a> play;
               it can't just be “a play”, it has to be a “queer play”.
               That's what frustrates me about it.</p>
            <h4>So do you think theatre needs to better reflect the diversity and change within our culture?</h4>
            <p>I think that it is our responsibility, and it is also about what we are doing for the young <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span class="entity">LGBT</span></a>
               community; people who are struggling to come out or come to terms with their own sexual identity.
               They can go and watch a play like Angels in America, a masterpiece in terms of its writing, but it's
               quite a narrow representation of what it means to be gay.
               We need to honour those past playwrights as landmarks of gay theatre, but also ask what's current and
               contemporary.</p>
            <h4>Many gay actors around the world fear coming out as they worry about the impact it could have on being
               cast in straight roles, what is your opinion there?</h4>
            <p>I know many actors who are gay or lesbian and who are not out for that very reason.
               Look at Hollywood: 12 years ago everyone applauded <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Gyllenhaal" target="_blank"><span class="person">Jake Gyllenhaal</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Ledger"
                  target="_blank"><span class="person">Heath Ledger</span></a> for playing gay in <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokeback_Mountain" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Brokeback Mountain</span></a>,
               but when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Patrick_Harris" target="_blank"><span
                     class="person">Neil Patrick Harris</span></a> played Barney in <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother" target="_blank"><span class="entity">How I Met Your Mother</span></a> the reaction wasn't, “Isn't that interesting, he's gay and he's playing
               straight,” it was, “I had no idea, you can't even tell he's gay!”</p>
            <p>It's the stereotype that being homosexual is somehow a visible entity.
               Whilst it is inherent to your identity it's not something that is necessarily aesthetic and visible.
               I think it comes from society as well. Sadly, we still live in a world without equal rights. Whilst we
               might have equal rights on paper, that doesn't equal social rights.
               There's still homophobia. There needs to be a fundamental shift in society as well as in entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>I think theatre is a great place to start, as from there it can often bleed into film and TV, and theatre
               is often at the forefront of change in the arts.
               But I think that it's also just about creating a safer space and not goading people into coming out.
               If they're comfortable to, then they should, but it's not something we should be witch-hunting gay actors
               for.
               That could be more damaging than progressive.</p>
            <h4>Do you think theatre and the stories being told today reflect the diversity and change in our culture,
               or would you like to see more variety?</h4>
            <p>I would love to see more plays with trans characters in them as they just don't exist at the minute.
               The reason that I work in casting is because I'm passionate about diversity in theatre, yet it's really
               important in writing too.
               But, if we commission five trans writers to write a play, are we saying that trans writers can only write
               trans stories?
               We certainly don't make that assumption with white writers, black writers, female writers or anyone else.
            </p>
            <p>You still do get plays with all white casts, or all men, or the only female roles in it are defined by
               their relationships with male characters.
               While they frustrate me, I think they should exist, but we should look to learn and move forward too.
               A play like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_House_(play)" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">This House</span></a>, for example, had an all-white cast when it ran at the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">NT</span></a>; on paper you think that's negative because there's no diversity.
               But within the setting, it is needed because the people they are playing are all white, and at that time
               our government was almost entirely white.
               There's very little diversity in Parliament, and it would be counter-productive to cast that play
               regardless of race and gender because the source material, the point of the play, is that this country is
               largely run by white politicians.</p>
            <p>So casting must reflect the validity of the writing, as there's often a call-to-arms whenever there's a
               production announced with an all-white cast.
               And quite often rightly. But we shouldn't be so quick to judge the decision making.
               I think we're getting there. It's also the responsibility of drama schools to make training more
               accessible.</p>
            <h4>Do you think that drama schools in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"
                  target="_blank"><span class="place">UK</span></a> need to take more responsibility for encouraging
               diversity?</h4>
            <p>Absolutely! We don't read and cast a play thinking, “OK, that role will be a funny part: they'll be
               northern and maybe a bit chubby.” That's not how casting works anymore.
               A lot of plays are built on the traditional character stereotypes – the leading lady, the ingénue, the
               comic relief.
               But I think that there's a lot more freedom in plays.</p>
            <p>I'm always amazed by the creative process of working with directors who might say, “This is what I think
               for that role,”, but others might be completely open in the way they see it.
               We are facilitators of a process and so it is our job to flesh out that idea and meet actors who do fit
               the brief, as well as bringing new ideas to the table.
               For one role in particular, it was entirely open and we met older women, children, disabled artists,
               cabaret performers, and that from a casting perspective is so exciting.</p>
            <p>I think, particularly in musicals, those binaries still exist.
               When you look at training in musical theatre you can often point out exactly what they've tried to
               achieve with each graduate.
               I find that quite frustrating at showcases.
               The demand for diversity at the moment is incredibly high and I think drama schools need to address that
               balance.</p>
            <h4>Should actors use their platform as a voice for change, as famously happened at a production of
               Hamilton, or is their job simply to entertain?</h4>
            <p>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">Hamilton</span></a>, I would have absolutely done the same thing. I think that it's
               not just the responsibility of actors or people who work in the arts to say that, it's the responsibility
               of everyone. If you disagree with something, speak out in a productive way.
               If you look at something like <span class="entity">Act for Change</span> and the way that they have been
               campaigning, that's been the start of something which has really helped speed up the journey to
               diversity.</p>
            <p>Myself and others within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre"
                  target="_blank"><span class="entity">National Theatre</span></a> have spoken out in favour of more
               representation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">LGBT</span></a> in the programming. There was a huge minority of gay characters, if
               at all.
               Focus has been on diversity within age, gender, ethnicity and disability, which are all incredibly
               important, but because being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">LGBT</span></a> isn't something necessarily visible, yet it's still something that
               exists, it needs to be represented.</p>
            <p>In terms of what theatre can do for society, I think that it's amazing that after Brexit and all the hate
               crimes against non-white communities,
               when you look at the programming of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre"
                  target="_blank"><span class="entity">National</span></a>, <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donmar_Warehouse" target="_blank"><span class="entity">The
                     Donmar</span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Court_Theatre"
                  target="_blank"><span class="entity">The Court</span></a>,
               as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">Fringe</span></a> and regional theatres they've created incredible productions with
               diverse creative teams and stood up and spoken out to say the current situation isn't acceptable.
               That's so exciting and I think it's what makes London theatre really bloody good.</p>
            <h4>And do you think it is theatre's job to lead the way in exploring topics like equality and giving voice
               to minority groups, particularly given the shift in global politics we have seen lately?</h4>
            <p>I think it's more important than ever. We have sadly created a country and a world where we are fighting
               for equal representation.
               Theatre needs to say that it continues to be open and accessible; exploring stories from all cultures and
               all creeds.
               And they are equally as important as one another. It is leading in TV and film too, perhaps not as
               rapidly as theatre, which is so important because often they are more accessible than theatre. If you
               look at something like Dr Who and the diversity of that cast and the representation of BAME and <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span class="entity">LGBT</span></a>
               characters, it’s exciting to see that progression and hopefully it is a catalyst for change.</p>
            <h4>With the advancements in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">LGBT</span></a>+ rights, to what degree do you still think events like Pride are
               necessary and do they have a positive impact?</h4>
            <p>I think it's still incredibly important. As I said before, in the <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" target="_blank"><span class="place">UK</span></a>
               we are equal on paper to our heterosexual counterparts but we still don't have real social equality.
               I find it remarkable that I can legally marry someone of my own sex and adopt, but if I were to kiss
               someone in the street I'd have to be aware of where I was and what that means.</p>
            <p>Something that really struck me was [the events in] <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida" target="_blank"><span
                     class="place">Orlando</span></a>, and the way that was dealt with in the press. It was labelled as
               a “terrorist attack” and not a “gay attack” because there are still a lot of readers who aren't pro-gay.
               So we've still got a long way to go, and I think that <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_parade" target="_blank"><span
                     class="entity">Pride</span></a> is still important in terms of identity and community.</p>
            <h4>What advice would you give to young actors or industry professionals who fear their sexuality may hold
               them back or present a block in a highly competitive industry?</h4>
            <p>The best advice I can say is to know yourself well; be secure and happy in yourself. There will always be
               a social barrier until we fight to pull it down. If you're in a rehearsal or at an audition and someone
               says “play this gay character and flounce around,” ask why. Is that a character trait? Where does that
               come from? Or is that just trying to shove a gay character in without thinking about the implications of
               what it means?</p>
            <p>Really be yourself, don't try to be something that you're not. You'll spend a six or eight-week rehearsal
               process developing a fully-rounded character.
               You can't possibly play a role as just one thing. It's definitely the duty of the casting director to not
               be so closed-minded as to say: “That actor is gay so they couldn't possibly play a straight character.”
               That's like saying, “That person's a woman, so they can't play a male character”.
               As an industry, we need to stop adhering to such binary terms. But there is progression, which is
               excellent.</p>
            <p class="footer">I see actors worry about so many things when walking into an audition – “Did I shake hands
               with the right person?”, “Am I wearing the right shoes?” – but beyond everything else, just read the
               play.
               Be passionate and able to talk about it. It's an artistic process, not about filling slots or applying a
               binary label. It's much more creative than that, which is what makes it exciting.</p>
