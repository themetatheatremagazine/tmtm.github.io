		<p class="capital">A research project reveals past and currentgender inequities in an excellent music program. How
		inclusive is</p>
		<p>Abstract: Greater diversity and inclusivity in music curricula are goals that permeate discussions in education <a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a>. Achieving these goals, however, is complex and presents inherent difficulties as music not only values tradition but also promotes the past. Many music traditions were exclusionary and unintentionally cultivated a culture in which many people today continue to be marginalized. Faculty and students in a <span class="place">Wisconsin music department</span> created a project titled <span class="entity">“A Year of Inclusivity,”</span> which sought to recognize exclusionary practices in the department and highlight contributions of underrepresented composers and other musicians in performance programming and curriculum. Our goal was to influence future directions for our department as well as help all our students, including preservice teachers, reconsider their roles as ambassadors of musical culture.</p>
		<p >Greater diversity and inclusivity in music  curricula  is one goal that permeates discussions in  education. ’ Because music programs are often steeped in past traditions that were exclusionary as to gender and race, they can unintentionally cultivate a culture that continues to marginalize students, faculty, and community members <a class="biblioRef" href="#b02">2</a>. Through a project called <span class="entity">“A Year of Inclusivity”</span> that took place during the <time class="year">2013— 14</time> academic year, faculty and students in the Music Department of the University of <span class="place">Wisconsin—Eau Claire</span> sought to create a music curriculum that highlighted the contributions of underrepresented composers and other musicians.  We sought to recognize exclusionary practices  in our department and to deconstruct them through changes in concert programming and course curriculum, faculty- student collaborative research projects, faculty- and student led presentations, and special guests throughout the year. Our goal was to help all our students, many of whom are preservice teachers, to reconsider their roles as ambassadors of musical culture.
		While our music program  is part of a four-year college and focuses on classical music and jazz with a large teacher education program, all components of this project, including all research and performance-related elements, could be conducted at the high school or middle school level with little modification. The project could even be adapted for use with grade school students, who might be among the greatest beneficiaries. We encouraged our preservice teachers to think about how the results of this project would affect their choices as teachers later in their careers, believing that these ideas are relevant  to  students of all ages. This type of project in a grade school or middle school setting could impact fundamental ways that students choose to engage with music, such as with musical instrument and ensemble selection or composition. If conducted in a K—12 setting, this type of project could reach a more diverse group of students, in comparison to most college settings.
		The idea for <span class="entity">A Year of  Inclusivity</span> emerged in an upper-level music history course on gender issues in music. Throughout the course, students voiced their frustrations concerning issues of ongoing gender inequity in the music world. They were frustrated to learn, for example, that among contemporary compos- ers with works featured on recent orchestral seasons and new-music series, only 15 percent were women or that as of fifteen years ago only 2.4 percent of the 500 top-grossing films were scored by  female  composers<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">3</a>. In course discussions, students concluded that for more women to enter the compositional realm, strong and prominent modeling needs to occur throughout the music world, includ- ing the concert  halls  and classrooms in our music program. We questioned how students in our music program internalize a musical world in  which the majority of concerts still only represent the work  of  one gender.  Out  of this exchange, one of the students suggested the idea for A Year of Inclusivity. During the previous year, our faculty had provided important groundwork for such a project with numerous discussions in which inclusivity and relevance kept appearing as important values as we addressed a new departmental mission statement and new student outcomes for our various music degrees.
		The first major task was to determine the focus of the project. The  term underrepresented was selected because of its inclusive nature, raising such issues as gender, racial or cultural background, and sexual orientation, and also because of its intentional ambiguity, which  we hoped would prompt valuable discussion. Ultimately, our project revolved around two goals: (1) identifying. and addressing exclusionary practices surrounding gender in our program.
		(2) increasing awareness of the challenges in multicultural programming and increasing the representation of the work of musicians outside of the white European American traditions. This article addresses the various facets of A Year of Inclusivity and offers a model that could be adapted by programs interested in conducting similar work from grade school through college.</p>

			<h3>Gender: Overview</h3>
			<p>Recognizing exclusionary practices surrounding gender served as an important launching point for this project. We live in a time in which feminism sometimes has negative connotations and gender inequity is not always recognized as an issue<a class="biblioRef" href="#b04">4</a>. Understanding our personal roles in maintaining inequity is essential for moving forward. Multiple faculty student projects were conducted to ciiscover patterns of exclusion pertaining to gender throughout the history of our program. We conducted research on gender inequity as it related to conducting, musical instrument selection, jazz participation, and concert programming. For each project, the findings were presented through research posters that were displayed in the central lobby of the department throughout the year as well as at a university-wide undergraduate research symposium.</p>

			<h3>Conducting</h3>
			<p>The exclusionary history of conducting in our department was a revelation to many of our students, half of whom are women, with many intending to be conductors of ensembles in K—12 contexts. Since <span class="date">1927</span>, the year in which a founding female member of the program resigned, women have not served as a permanent conductor in a tenure-track position of a large ensemble (i.e., band, orchestra or choir), and they have only rarely and sporadically appeared on the podium as temporary or guest conductors. In a program with multiple bands, choirs, and orchestras, approximately twenty concerts have been conducted by women since <span class="date">1917</span>. Over the years, there have been eight women con- ductors. All of them conducted choirs, and in all but two situations, they con- ducted an entry-level choir without music majors. The only instrumental ensemble to be conducted by a female was the entry-level band generally without music majors, and this woman only conducted a single concert.
			Our   program  is  not  unique in
			its predominance of male ensemble conductors but rather reflects broader statewide trends, reinforcing the importance of  this issue<a class="biblioRef" href="#b05">5</a>.  In a faculty-student collaborative project, data were gathered concerning the gender of ensemble conductors for the 2013—14 academic year for all postsecondary institutions in Wisconsin accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music<a class="biblioRef" href="#b06">6</a>. (See Figure 1 for statistics on pat- terns of conductor gender at post- secondary institutions in Wisconsin, 2013— 14). Reflecting the situation in our department, the majority of women conductors at postsecondary schools in <span class="place">Wisconsin</span> that year conducted women’s choirs. Only 30 percent of the conductors of mixed- gender choirs were women, and for instrumental ensembles, even fewer, about 10 percent to 15 percent of the conductors, were women.
			One way to challenge the exclusive male-dominated conducting models in our program for our students was to highlight our female founders who conducted numerous and diverse ensembles. Another faculty—student collaborative research project focused on the contributions of female faculty during the first thirty years of our program (1916—o6) through material in the university archives<a class="biblioRef" href="#b07">7</a> .During the early history of our program, women faculty taught music education to future teachers at the primary grade and grammar school levels, but they were also responsible for organizing the music ensembles such as  glee clubs for women and men, a mixed- gender choir, a male quartet, the orchestra, and a mandolin  club (Photo 1 is a picture of Wisconsin State Normal School’s Men’s Glee Club with <span class="person">Grace Gail Giberson </span>in <span class="date">1917</span>).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b08">8</a>
			From her arrival in the fall of <time class="date">1923</time> until her resignation twenty- five years later, <span class="person">Clara Mae Ward</span> worked to established the <span class="place">Wisconsin State Normal School</span>as a prominent music program in the Midwest, and she  became  known as “one of Wisconsin’s foremost music directors.” (Photo 2 shows Clara Mae Ward with the Wisconsin State Normal School Orchestra in 1924)<a class="biblioRef" href="#b09">9</a>. In addition to teaching an array of education courses, she organized five vocal ensembles, the orchestra, and the band. The premier music ensemble, the A Cappella Choir, performed regularly on campus, throughout <span class="place">Wisconsin</span>, and in neighboring states, as well as on weekly half-hour radio broadcasts.Highlights included performances at World Fairs in <span class="place">Chicago and New York</span> and a performance at the White House for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt <a class="biblioRef" href="#b10">10</a>. In 1946, a male conductor was hired to direct the instrumental ensembles, the next year another male conductor was hired to direct vocal  ensembles, and in <time class="date">1953</time>, a woman was hired to teach music education, marking a significant shift and division in gender roles among faculty in the music program that continues to this day.</p>

			<h3>Musical Instruments and Jazz</h3>
			We also documented the association of gender with musical instruments and with jazz in the history of our music program <a class="biblioRef" href="#b11">11</a>. Gender distribution for almost all instruments has become more balanced over the past fifty years in our music program, and yet still today gender associations prevail. While most musicians, and indeed most individuals, are familiar with these associations, quantifying the history of this gender imbalance helped to increase an understand- ing of its implications <a class="biblioRef" href="#b12">12</a>. Table 1 documents the clear association of wind and percussion instruments with a particular gender as well as  the  trend  in  the  past fifty years
			of females selecting nontraditional instruments at greater  rates  than the males. Throughout the  history of  our  music  program, woodwinds have predominantly been played by female students; flute, oboe, and clarinet players continue to be 80 percent or more female. The flute has the strongest association, with only 3.4 percent of all flute players during the past decade being males, an increase of only 1 percent since the 1960s.  The  one  exception  is the saxophone, which is the most gender-neutral wind instrument in the department. Brass instruments and percussion, in contrast, are much more frequently played by male students, with the one exception being the French horn, which has been played predominantly by women.
			In general, the ensembles have reflected a blend of male and female students throughout the program’s history, with one exception  being the jazz bands, which have always been male  dominated  (see  Table 2). In the <span class="date">1970s</span>, only 7.7 percent of instrumentalists in Jazz I ensemble were women, though the number expanded in the <span class="date">1980s</span> to an  average of 11. 5  percent.  During  the next twenty-five  years,   however, the   presence   of   female   students in Jazz I decreased. In the <span class="date">1990s</span>, only 4.1 percent of the personnel of Jazz I were women, and since <span class="date">2000</span>, only 5. 2 percent have been women. This means that typically, there  is one woman in a band  of  about twenty musicians.  Larger  numbers of women perform with Jazz II and Jazz III, with the number of women being approximately two to three times larger than in Jazz I. The statistics demonstrate how gender
			remains a crucial factor in whether a student will participate in jazz bands in our music program.
			As part of the project, research posters were displayed that contextualized the aforementioned statistics with scholarship on factors affecting musical instrument selection and participation in jazz programs<a class="biblioRef" href="#b13">13</a>. In addition, Gail Robertson, a euphonium player and jazz musician and arranger , was invited to give a master class and performance to serve as a model to our students<a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a>. Reflecting the project’s effects, a few female students who were members of the jazz ensembles chose to pur- sue research projects on these issues for various courses. </p>

			<h3>Concen Programming</h3>
			<p>An important aspect of determining exclusionary practices in our program was specifically identifying patterns of gender in concert programming <a class="biblioRef" href="#b16">16</a>. In our music program up through the 1970s, only 1 percent of concert repertoire was composi- tions by women, and despite major societal changes with second-wave feminism during the 1960s and 1970s,   this   percentage   increased to only 1.5 percent for the 1980s and to 3 percent for the 1990—2005 period. (It should be noted, however, that each year more compositions are programmed, so a constant percentage indicates an increase in actual numbers of compositions by women). The programming during the eight-year period from 2005 to 2013   showed   a   noted   increase to
			6 percent. (See Figure 2 for patterns in programming by gender). Throughout the history of the music program, the performances of compositions by women have been con- centrated in certain divisions and ensembles. Since 2005,  80  percent of the compositions by women performed by large ensembles on our campus  have  been  by choral groups,
			10 percent by  concert bands,  and 10 percent by jazz bands. Despite historical explanations for these patterns, these statistics speak to how the programming of our major ensembles represent and reinforce long-held traditions tied to gender.1‘
			Whether to place  compositions of underrepresented composers on specialized   programs   or include them   as  part   of   mainstream programming is an important  question in a project like this. Some people think that singling out programs dedicated to women composers is not only unnecessary but contributes  to a stigma  against  which these
			individuals    must   fight<a class="biblioRef" href="#b17">17</a>. In  Specialized
			programming of works by women, however, has been significant for the representation of women in our music program,  often  amounting to half of the programmed compositions by women. For example, during the <span class="date">2011—12</span> concert season, more than half of the included pieces by women were tied to specialized programming. Table 3 reveals how slowly compositions by women are being incorporated into mainstream concerts in our music program.
			In the area of concert programming, <span class="entity">A Year of Inclusivity</span> had a significant statistical impact. The perce ntage of compositions by women almost tripled to 17 percent of the music presented<a class="biblioRef" href="#b18">18</a>. The influence of the project  was  also evident in the types of works included on concerts. Of special note were two compositions for orchestra (including Amy Beach’s Mass in  E-Flat Major ) , a percussion concerto by Jennifer Higdon  for  wind   band, and opera  scenes  by  three  different female composers. In addition, studio recitals  were  dedicated   to the works of women composers, including a piano studio, an oboe studio, and two voice-area recitals.Guests who were invited to high-
			light the work of women composers included composer <span class="person">Libby Larsen</span>; <span class="person">Cynthia Green Libby</span>, oboe player and member of the Board of Directors of the International Alliance of Women in Music; and the Farrenc Piano Trio based in LaCrosse, <span class="place">Wisconsin</span>. The titles  and performers  of all of the events that  were  part  of <span class="entity">A Year of Inclusivity</span> were compiled and displayed throughout the year.</p>

			<h3>Multicultural Programming</h3>
			<p>A Year of <span class="entity">Inclusivity</span> was not as successful increasing the  programming of works by composers outside the white European American main- stream, though complex issues surrounding this goal were central  to our discussions. These compositions were diverse and came from classi- cal, jazz, popular, folk, and world- music traditions. For example, we sought to increase  the  performance of classical compositions by African American composers, such as Flor- ence Price, but also expand the styles of music, such as with a guest musician and storyteller from Ghana. An initial difficulty, much more so than with gender,  was  the  determination if compositions fell into the category of underrepresented. The more time- consuming, and often impossible, process of identifying the racial back- ground of a composer, in comparison to identifying the gender of a composer, made it infeasible to determinethe same types of statistics concerning exclusionary practices. In recent years in our program, however, works by composers outside the white European American tradition was just over 5 percent, just below the percentage of programmed compositions by women. Reflecting the positive impact of A Year of <span class="entity">Inclusivity</span>Inclusivity, over twice as many classical works were programmed by composers outside of the white European American tradition as during the previous season. While approximately 70 percent of pieces programmed as part of the project were by women, 30 percent
			were by composers outside the white European American tradition. Valuable concerts were provided that expanded student and faculty knowledge of music in this category, such as a piano studio recital dedicated to the “Piano Music of Africa and the African Diaspora. ” <a class="biblioRef" href="#b19">19</a>
			Part of the goal of this project was to stimulate discussion on the criteria for appropriate multicultural programming. A central question is  whether  a  composition  is an  “authentic”  representation   of the culture or not. With so many sources  available  to  teachers  with “ multicultural ” materials, various questions should be asked. Who produ ced the composition and through what process? Is the composition actually a product of the culture it represents? Does it reflect stereotypes? Is it based on cultural appropriation  and  embody  issues of colonialism? <a class="biblioRef" href="#b20">20</a>. If it is an authentic piece from another culture, is a concert hall performance by outsiders appropriate? Are there special issues of style and interpretation that need consideration? Finally, is the work being treated with the same type of respect as other compositions on the program?
			A valuable part of A Year of <span class="entity">Inclusivity</span> was a faculty—student collaborative research project that compared a set of compositions with these questions in mind. Amanda Hicklin, a music education
			student, surveyed our department’s recent programming and identified compositions that raised issues of appropriation and authenticity. She determined that during the <span class="date">2011-12</span> concert season, compositions were performed that appropriated music from twenty-three different cultures. A complex example she addressed was <span class="person">John Barnes Chance’</span> Variations on a Korean Fold Song for wind hand, which is often perceived as representative of a uthentic Korean techniques, such  as  with   its “ use of Oriental harmonies. ” <a class="biblioRef" href="#b21">21</a>  This  set of variations is  based  on  the  tune of the folk  song  “Arirang, ”  which is considered an unofficial national anthem of Korea, representing  hope in the face of  hardship and  recently in c1 ude d on	the	United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization’s list of Intangible Cultural  Property,  showing  how  integral the song is to Korea’s cultural identity. Chance became familiar with the folk song when he was sta- tioned in Korea during the American occupation of Korea in the <span class="date">1940s</span>.
			Even though the composer’s arrangement of the melody, harmony, instrumentation, and other stylistic elements of the piece have been seen as accurately  represent- ing Korean folk traditions, issues of appropriation and misrepresentation arise. Does the piece serve as a valuable and respectful representation of Korean culture, or is  it  an  example of appropriation by an outsider? The conclusions  of  this project emrha
			sized the importance  of distinguishing between arrangements of folk material based on appropriation and “authentic”   reprentations  of folk
			music. The project also emphasized the importance of people telling their own stories rather than having them told through an outside perspective. Amanda Hicklin summarized the value of the yearlong project in the following way:
			No music exists in a vacuum, and this research project made clear some of the innumerable historical and cultural threads which run through every song we sing or play. The depth of my students’ musical understanding is directly tied to the depth of their cultural understandings. The use of authentic materials is crucial to building a strong foundation for that knowledge, and the use of inauthentic materials would be like building a house on a faulty foundation.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b22">22</a> </p>

		<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
		<p>For a wide range of faculty members and students, A Year of <span class="entity">Inclusivity</span> emphasized the importance of identifying exclusionary practices in our music program and becoming more inclusive, so all students, regardless of gender or race, could more easily see themselves represented in the concert hall and the broader cur- riculum. The r roject challenged us
		to  recognize  exclusionary practices
		that have been long engrained into our educational practices and question their presence. More generally, faculty and students recognized the power of unifying  energy  through a  central purpose  and  across  discir lines.  A  year  after  the  project,  its
		effect on  the department  is evident.
		Faculty and students are pursuing projects from performing compositions by women at international meetings to revising music history series to forming a committee to address issues of diversity.
		Students were important at all stages of the process, from planning to execution, as they had insights and commitment to issues of diversity. Students were involved in the majority of the project’s performances: Almost half the per- forman ces of underrepresented composers' works were solo performances by students, and almost one-third were by student ensembles. Before defining the project, it is important to identify exclusionary practices as manifested in past con- cert programs and syllabi. Students and faculty need to recognize how the program has been reinforcing noninclusive patterns. It would be
		ideal to correlate the areas of exclusion with the goals of  the project. For example, is it possible to identify which ensemble has been most heavily influenced by exclusionary practices? Find examples of inclusion in the program’s history  to serve as models to help deconstruct exclusionary practices. While concert programming will most  likely be an important part of the project, examine other aspects of the curriculum for noninclusive approaches. While not all faculty might want to participate, it was helpful to have participants from different disciplines.  Finally,  while  our  goal  of “ highlighting the work of underrepresented composers and musicians”  was inc lusive  and   resulted in broad participation, a narrower goal would have produced more targeted results. Some members of  our department have already started discussing plans for a project that focuses on music by members of some of America’s minorities.
		Regardless of grade level, this
		type of project can have a meaningful impact. Middle school and high school students could identify patterns of gender in music in their own school districts. Recognizing and discussing discrepancies in gender among ensemble conductors could influence students when they are making important career choices. Students could determine how the number of women band conductors in their districts compares  to  the  nationwide   average at the college level of 5 percent <a class="biblioRef" href="#b23">23</a>. Similarly, students could document gender statistics for musical instruments and jazz in their own school at a time when they are still selecting instruments and ensembles. As at the college level, students could survey past concert programs and solo and ensemble lists for issues of diversity, and more inclusive programming could be planned.
		<span class="person">Jonathan Conjurske</span>,an oboe
		performance  student,  participated
		fully  in the  project  and incorporated underrepresented works in his senior recital. His observations on the project sum up its significance well:
		By seeking out quality pieces of music by  underrepresented  composers,  such as <span class="person">Madeleine Dring's</span> Trio for flute, Ohoe
		and Piano, I  believe  I ant doing  y  part  as I performer to further diversify our tradition  of  classical  music performance.
		My experience with the Year of <span class="entity">Inclusivity</span> project taught me that the performer, now mr›re than  ever  before,  must  work to communicate a welcoming message of inclusion with the increasingly diverse audience of the twenty-first century; an audience composed of all tenders, sexes, and ethnic groups. One cannot achieve equality through the narrow selection of one gender anal race’s creative output or voice. To keep our art alive and relevant, all voices must be heard, shared, and appreciated <a class="biblioRef" href="#b24">24</a>.</p>
