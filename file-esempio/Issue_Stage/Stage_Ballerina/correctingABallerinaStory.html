      <h2> II-A TROUBLED TOUR BEGINGS</h2>
      <p>In <time datetime="1909">1909</time>, convinced that ballet had become stuffy and dull, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> founded "<span class="entity">Les Ballets Russes</span>" ("<span class="entity">The Russian Ballets</span>").<a class="biblioRef" href="#b04">4</a> By
 <time datetime="1914">1914</time>, the company had become successful enough that <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>
 began looking into the possibility of an American tour.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b05">5</a> When <span class="person">Addie Kahn</span> (the wife of <span class="person">Otto Kahn</span>, the chairman of the <span class="entity">Metropolitan Opera</span>'s board of directors) threw her support behind the idea, a
 booking was quickly arranged.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b06">6</a></p>
     <p>Unable to work in <span class="place">Russia</span> due to the war, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> rented a home
 in <span class="place">Switzerland</span><a class="biblioRef" href="#b08">7</a> and from there instructed <span class="person">Serge Grigoriev</span>, his right
 hand man (as well as the company's rehearsal director), to hire
 <span class="person">Tamara Karsavin</span>a for the tour.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b08">8</a> When she had to beg off because
 she was pregnant,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b09">9</a> <span class="person">Grigoriev</span> wrote to <span class="person">Olga Spessivtzeva</span> and offered
 her the role of prima ballerina.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b10">10</a> Although initially interested, <span class="person">Spessivtzeva</span> was convinced by critic <span class="person">Akin Volinsky</span>, who disapproved of
 <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>'s modern corps de ballet, to decline.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b11">11</a> With these rejections hanging over his head, <span class="person">Grigoriev</span> went to <span class="place">Moscow</span> and while
 there hired <span class="person">Makletzova</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b12">12</a></p>
     <p> Born in <time datetime="1892">1892</time> in <span class="place">Saint Petersburg</span>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b13">13</a> <span class="person">Makletzova</span> had been dancing
 in public exhibitions since she was eight years old.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b14">14</a> After graduating
 from the <span class="entity">Bolshoi Ballet School</span> in <time datetime="1908">1908</time>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b15">15</a> she joined the <span class="entity">Bolshoi Ballet School</span> as a soloist.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b16">16</a> By the time <span class="person">Grigoriev</span> met her, she was
 under contract to the <span class="entity">Imperial Government Theatre</span> in <span class="place">Moscow</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b17">17</a></p>
     <p>Impressed with her experience, <span class="person">Grigoriev</span> told <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> that he had
 found a suitable replacement for <span class="person">Karsavina</span>. <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>, however,
 thought otherwise and told <span class="person">Grigoriev</span> to "continue looking for someone better, but failing that engage <span class="person">Makletzova</span>."<a class="biblioRef" href="#b18">18</a> When <span class="person">Grigoriev</span>'s
 further searches proved fruitless, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> hired <span class="person">Makletzova</span>.</p>
     <p>On <time datetime="1915-09-18">September 18,1915</time>, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> and <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> signed a formal
 contract in <span class="place">Saint Petersburg</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b19">19</a> Written in Russian and running 10
 paragraphs in length, its terms can be briefly summarized as follows:</p>
       <ol>
         <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed to be the <span class="entity">Ballets Russes</span>'s prima ballerina until <time datetime="1916-05-1">May
         1,1916</time>. She also agreed to attend rehearsals in <span class="place">Switzerland</span> and appear
         in two charity events.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed to perform the starring role in six ballets: <i><span class="entity">L'Oiseau de Feu</span></i> [<span class="entity">The Firebird</span>]; <i><span class="entity">Pavillon d'Armide</span></i> [<span class="entity">Armide's House</span>]; <i><span class="entity">Les Sylphides</span></i>
         [<span class="entity">The Nymphs</span>]; <i><span class="entity">Carnival</span></i>; <i><span class="entity">Petrouchka·</span></i>, and <i><span class="entity">Dafins and Kloia</span></i>.
         <!--ho usato <i> e non <em> perché sono in corsivo solo i nomi stranieri e non i titoli degli spettacoli in generale--></li>
         <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed not to dance or do "anything in her profession, publically or for private persons, or moving picture films," without <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>'s consent.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Diaghilev</span> agreed to pay <span class="person">Makletzova</span> 2,000 francs a month until the company reached the <span class="place">United States</span>. Once in the <span class="place">United States</span>, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>
         agreed to pay <span class="person">Makletzova</span> 4,250 rubles a month.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b20">20</a> <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> also agreed
         to pay <span class="person">Makletzova</span>'s "railroad fares [and] steamship ticket, first class,
         wherever she may go for purposes of performing" and provide her with a return ticket to <span class="place">Moscow</span>.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed to forfeit 200 rubles for each performance she missed due to illness.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Diaghilev</span> agreed that if <span class="person">Makletzova</span> was required to pay to get out of her existing contract with the <span class="entity">Imperial Government Theatre</span>, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>
          would reimburse her up to a maximum of 2,000 rubles. <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> also agreed to give <span class="person">Makletzova</span> an advance of 3,000 rubles before she left
          <span class="place">Saint Petersburg</span>.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> and <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> agreed that if either of them breached the
          contract, the other would be entitled to 18,500 rubles. In addition, the non-breaching party would be released from the contract.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Diaghilev</span> agreed that <span class="person">Makletzova</span> would not be required to appear in
         more than two performances per evening. <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> also agreed that
         daytime performances were to be held only once a week, during which <span class="person">Makletzova</span> would be required to dance only one ballet.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Diaghilev</span> and <span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed that the contract could be extended
          by mutual consent to <time datetime="1916-09-1">September 1,1915</time>.</li>
         <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed to forfeit 100 rubles if she failed to attend a daytime
         performance.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b21">21</a></li>
       </ol>
     <p>Now that <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> had his prima ballerina, he assembled the rest
 of the troupe and began rehearsals.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b22">22</a> In <time datetime="1916-12">December 1915</time>, the company gave two European charity performances.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b23">23</a> With the shows
 having garnered superb reviews,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b24">24</a> the company set sail from <span class="place">Bordeaux</span> on <time datetime="1916-01-01">January 1,1916</time> in high spirits.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b25">25</a></p>
     <p>In New York, the company's first performance took place on <time datetime="1916-01-17">Monday, January 17</time>, at the <span class="entity">Century Theatre</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b26">26</a> For months, <span class="person">Edward L. Bernays</span>, the <span class="entity">Met's press</span> agent, had been whetting the public's appetite by filling countless magazines and newspapers with stories
 about the company's arrival,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b27">27</a> and throughout the country manufacturers had been churning out products based on the company's
 distinctive costumes.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b28">28</a> But this massive advertising campaign had
 raised expectations too high, especially because it had been built
 around <span class="person">Nijinsky</span> and <span class="person">Karsavina</span>, neither of whom was with the tour.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b29">29</a>
 As a result, the opening night reviews were brutal, with most of the
 criticism aimed squarely at <span class="person">Makletzova</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b30">30</a> As one observer succinctly
 put it, "the weakest point of 'The Firebird' was the bird herself."<a class="biblioRef" href="#b31">31</a></p>
     <p>On the other hand, audiences could not get enough of <span class="person">Makletzova</span>'s fellow dancer <span class="person">Lydia Lopokova</span><a class="biblioRef" href="#b32">32</a> and openly wondered why
 she did not have a bigger role.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b33">33</a> As if this was not bad enough, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> found himself under constant attack by conservatives, who
 accused him of obscenity, especially when the company performed <i><span class="entity">Schéhérazade</span></i> (which many felt promoted miscegenation).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b34">34</a></p>
     <p>On <time datetime="1916-01-29">Saturday, January 29</time>, the company gave its final <span class="place">New York</span>
 performance and moved on to <span class="place">Boston</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b35">35</a> Although <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> was
 hopeful that the tour would now go better, things actually got much worse.</p>

      <h2> III-A LAWSUIT IS BORN</h2>
      <p>The company's first performance in <span class="place">Boston</span> took place on <time datetime="1916-01-31">Monday, January 31</time>, at the <span class="entity">Boston Opera House</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b36">36</a> Shortly before the
 curtain rose, Makletzova was asked to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> instead of <em><span class="entity">Carnival</span></em>. Although she had done so in <span class="place">New York</span>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b37">37</a> she now refused unless she was paid an extra $150. The next
 day, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> and <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> had a heated conversation about the
 incident, during which <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> insisted that <span class="person">Makletzova</span> had orally
 agreed to change paragraph 2 of her contract to include <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b38">38</a> <span class="person">Makletzova</span> disagreed, insisting that the pair had
 merely discussed the possibility of an amendment.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b39">39</a></p>
 <!--in questa sezione sono in corsivo anche i nomi degli spettacoli in inglese, che ho reso con <em>-->
      <p><span class="person">Makletzova</span>'s unwillingness to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em>
 was not the only sore point between the pair. For some time, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> had been refusing to dance with <span class="person">Alexander Gavriloff</span>, claiming that his inexperience made him an unsafe partner. With
 audiences still rejecting <span class="person">Makletzova</span> (and clamoring for <span class="person">Lopokova</span>),
 <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> had finally had enough. On <time datetime="1916-02-02">Wednesday, February 2</time>, he
 fired her and gave her roles to <span class="person">Lopokova</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b40">40</a></p>
     <p>Upon learning that she had been terminated, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> tried
 to have the police arrest <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b41">41</a> When this attempt failed, she
 went to the <span class="entity">Russian consulate</span>, where she was similarly rebuffed.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b42">42</a>
 Undaunted, she hired a local attorney named <span class="person">Joseph Michelman</span>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b43">43</a>
 who promptly filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b44">44</a>
 In his countersuit, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> claimed that <span class="person">Makletzova</span>'s insubordination had left him with no choice but to replace her.</p>
     <p>The case was assigned to <span class="person">Judge Frederic H. Chase</span> of the <span class="entity">Suffolk
 County Superior Court</span> in <span class="place">Boston</span>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b45">45</a> who announced the trial would begin on <time datetime="1916-04-11">April 11, 1916</time>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b46">46</a> On <time datetime="1916-04-12">Wednesday, April 12</time>, the beautiful,
 dark-skinned, well-dressed<a class="biblioRef" href="#b47">47</a> <span class="person">Makletzova</span> took the stand and captivated the courtroom with her version of what had happened.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b48">48</a></p>
     <p>At the conclusion of the evidence, <span class="person">Judge Chase</span> instructed the
 jury to determine:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>if <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> and <span class="person">Makletzova</span> had amended paragraph 2 of their original contract to include <span class="person">The Enchanted Princess</span>;and, </li>
         <li>whether <span class="person">Makletzova</span>'s refusal to dance with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> had been justified.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b49">49</a></li>
      </ol>
 <p>Answering these questions "no" and "yes," the jury awarded <span class="person">Makletzova</span> $4,500.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b50">50</a>

    <section id="Rewriting_history">
      <h2> IV-REWRITING HISTORY</h2>
      <p> The relationship between <span class="person">Makletzova</span> and <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> was destined
 to end in conflict. While <span class="person">Makletzova</span> was an outspoken woman who
 loved being the center of attention and jealously guarded her prerogatives,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b51">51</a>
 <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> had a well-earned reputation for being demanding and difficult.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b52">52</a></p>
     <p>Although they had gotten along in <span class="place">Europe</span>, they came to blows
 almost as soon as they arrived in the <span class="place">United States</span>. Indeed, during
 one of the early <span class="place">New York</span> performances, <span class="person">Makletzova</span>, already in
 costume and five minutes from going on, threatened to walk out
 and relented only after a great deal of coaxing.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b53">53</a></p>
     <p>It was while they were in <span class="place">New York</span> that <span class="person">Makletzova</span> and <span class="person">Diaghilev</span>
 first discussed substituting <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> for <em><span class="entity">Carnival</span></em>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b54">54</a>
 When <span class="person">Makletzova</span> agreed to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> during
 the <span class="place">New York</span> opening, <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> thought that they had reached an
 agreement for the entire tour. As a result, he scheduled her to perform it again at the <span class="place">Boston</span> opening.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b55">55</a></p>
     <p><span class="person">Makletzova</span> later claimed she did not know she would be performing <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> until the morning of the <span class="place">Boston</span>
 opening. Even if true,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b56">56</a> it is interesting that she waited until 6:30
 p.m. to discuss the matter with <span class="person">Grigoriev</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b57">57</a> Moreover, at 9:00 p.m.,
 just 10 minutes before <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> was scheduled to
 begin, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> told <span class="person">Randolfo Barocchi</span>, the <span class="entity">Met</span>'s financial
 manager, that unless he immediately brought $150 to her dressing
 room she would not go on.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b58">58</a> Of course, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> knew that with a
 full house and no one to replace her, <span class="person">Barocchi</span> would have to comply.</p>
     <p><span class="person">Makletzova</span> also testified that she was reluctant to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> in <span class="place">Boston</span> because she had injured her toes (an
 explanation she was forced to back away from during cross-examination).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b59">59</a> In fact, after dancing <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> at the <span class="place">New York</span> opening, <span class="person">Makletzova</span> had consulted <span class="person">Victor E. Gartz</span>, an attorney
 whose clients included members of the Russian royal family.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b60">60</a> He advised her that her recent actions had not vitiated the contract,
 and that she was therefore free to turn down future requests to dance <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b61">61</a> Of course, in front of the jury <span class="person">Makletzova</span> sought to downplay the importance of her visit to <span class="person">Gartz</span> (as
 well as gain sympathy) by claiming she was injured.</p>
     <p><span class="person">Makletzova</span>'s testimony regarding her refusal to perform with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> was even more outrageous:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> claimed that <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> was unsuitable because he was an ensemble member rather than a featured player,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b62">62</a> but later admitted he
        had performed <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> with <span class="person">Lopokova</span> and others.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b63">63</a> In
        addition, <span class="person">Gavriloff</span>, who had trained at the <span class="entity">Maryinsky Ballet</span> and joined
        the <span class="entity">Ballets Russes</span> in 1911,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b64">64</a> was considered by <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> to be talented
        enough to serve as one of <span class="person">Nijinsky</span>'s understudies.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b65">65</a></li>
        <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> said she was afraid she would be injured if she had to dance
         with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span>, but let <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> know she would be willing to do so if he
         paid her extra.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b66">66</a> Indeed, throughout her time with the company <span class="person">Makletzova</span> repeatedly badgered <span class="person">Diaghilev</span> for money, which suggests she either had very expensive tastes or very large debts (or both).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b67">67</a></li>
        <li><span class="person">Makletzova</span> claimed that she was asked to dance with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> without
         being given time to rehearse with him. In fact, however, she had repeatedly turned down his practice requests.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b68">68</a></li>

      <h2> V-CONCLUSION </h2>
