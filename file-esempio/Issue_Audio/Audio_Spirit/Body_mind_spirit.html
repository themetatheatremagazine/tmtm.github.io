			<blockquote>When we  practice  mindfulness of breath, then the knowledge  of breath is mind.
				When we practice  mindfulness of the body,  then the knowledge  of body is mind.
				When we practice mindfulness of objects outside ourselves, then the knowledge of these objects is also mind .
				Therefore the contemplation of the nature of interdependence of all objects is also the contemplation of the mind. </blockquote>

			<p>As a performer, teacher and researcher on the subject of musician wellness , I have for some time thought about the goal of being at one with your instrument­ what it is like to get there, what it is like to teach a student to get there and what has been written about the body/mind/spirit connection that can help in this process.
			After attending some entrance audi­tions , I listened to my colleagues dis­sect the performance of  two prospective students  and  thought about what was and  was  not  said about their potential. I realized  that over the years I have learned to judge young students entering an undergrad­ uate program in music not simply on how well they played  at  that moment in their careers but  more importantly on their real musical potential-call it talent, call it work, call it giftedness or call it all of the above. Even if a stu­ dent has what you think it would take to fulfill their ambitions, will this indeed happen? What set of fortunate or unfortunate circumstances will crop up along their journey, as she or he discovers and then pursues that extraordinary interconnection of the body, mind and spirit chat eventually becomes a paramount issue within musical artistry?
			After reviewing some of my favorite texts on the  topic of the mind  and body connection in musici ans, I real­ized that this has been a popular sub­ ject for the entire era of what could be designated as the advent of musician wellness-from the <span class="date">1980s</span> through the present. Some of my favorite authors were the first to write on the topic. AB they point out, years of training, work and patience go into developing a sys­tem of preparation for  performance that engages the whole person- mind , emotions , imagination and bodily physique. Perfecting this system involves a fusion of technical mastery, aesthetic sensitivity and performance experience, while a connection of the interior and exterior, of the art it's musical physicality with his or her musical soul must be carefully cultivated. So, how does one get there? AB a teacher, I immediately evaluate how a particular student learns. Once I have discovered that, helping her or him learn good practice and performing techniques is a much easier task.
			Psychologically, students often have a great deal of anxiety about performing because they have not yet developed the necessary practice and preparation
			techniques. Moreover, most students have not yet had much experience at performing. However, once they devel­op those techniques and become aware of the interconnection of their body and mind, they do well. Teaching my stu­ dents to evaluate both what they do and how they do it is a very useful approach to reducing performance anxiety.
			In the Wellness in Performance course I team-teach at <span class="place">Salisbury University</span>, <span class="person">Bob McBrien</span>, a cognitive psychologist with both clinical and alternative therapy background, is one of my teaching colleagues. His special­ ty is progressive relaxation technique coupled with tai chi and  meditation. He works with students by teaching them how to use self-talk and affirmations and walks them through these processes. McBrien calls it the four step process:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>P-Personal</li>
					<li>P-Powerful</li>
					<li>P-Pinpoint</li>
					<li>P-Present</li>
					</ol>
			<p>Some alternative therapies helpful in gaining this kinesthetic connection include meditation techniques, pro­gressive relaxation, <span class="entity">Feldenkrais method</span> (pioneering movement awareness and creating links to body movements), <span class="entity">Alexander technique</span> (changing habits to improve coordination), tai chi, yoga as well as other alternative therapies.
			All of course require some reframing in how one approaches one's instrument.</p>
