		<section>
		<p>The beginning of the school year is a great time to prepare senior students for the upcoming college application and audition season. Many juniors are proactive and, from observing their own research. Often for those interested in singing, this means they will turn to their private instructor or, in many cases, their choral director for advice. For many teachers, who did not major in performance themselves, these are uncharted waters and the process for helping those students is often unclear. Because of the ever-changing entertainment industry, it is difficult for most teachers to stay in touch with what is expected for auditioning seniors. On the faculty side of the table, we often see the fruits of that uncertainty when otherwise talented students audition for programs they are not ready for, degrees that do not align with their career interests and with repertoire that is often inappropriate. To help teachers understand the differences, we will highlight two of the main university degree options for vocalists: musical theater and vocal performance, and offer a few audition tips to improve students' chances. </p>

			<h3>Understanding The Market</h3>
			<p>The arts have been drastically affected by the economy hardships of the last 1O years. While some may argue a student's pursuits in arts education should be targeted at artistic development rather than career preparation, for students who must pay their own way via student loans, job security is a real concern and should be discussed before amassing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans.In <span class="date">2008</span>, the <span class="entity">National Endowment  for  the Arts</span>  released its most recent survey on arts attendance. According to the NEA, 4.7 million adults attended an opera in the <span class="place">United States</span> during the time recorded. For musical theater, the number carne in at 47.6 million (Figure 1). Box office sales reports show $305 million in sales for opera in the <span class="place">United States</span> and <span class="place">Canada</span> and $1.8 billion for the 40 theaters that compose <span class="place">Broadway</span> and the app roximately 18 Equity touring shows 5 (Figure 2). These numbers give usa glimpse into the strength of musical theater and the very unfortunate struggles of opera, which can be important factors when considering employment opportunities.</p>

		<h3>Training Opportunities</h3>

			<p>Training opportunities for classical voice and musical theater are varied. According to  the Higher  <span class="entity">Education  Arts Data Services (HEADS) Project</span>, there are 383 schools offering a degree in vocal performance with 7,078 students enrolled. For musical theater training, there are approximately 61 schools currently offering BA and BFA degrees with 2,302 students enrolled (Figures 3 and 4).Because musical theater currently offers stronger employment potential and college programs are limited, admission has recently become extremely competitive for musical theater in comparison with vocal performance. While this has lead some teachers to consider musical theater a more competitive field than vocal performance, this may not be complerely accurate ourside the college audition process when considering that <span class="place">Broadway</span> alone outsells all of opera in the <span class="place">United States</span> by 300 percent  yet, when  you add in  the 2,015 graduate students in vocal performance, there are almost four times rhe number of students studying classically compared to rhose in musical theater programs.</p>

			<h3>Career Aspirations</h3>
			<p>If a student is absolutely certain he wants to pursue <span class="entity">opera</span>  or <span class="entity">musical theater</span>, the choice is fairly easy. However, it's the students who are unsure, who end  up confused  and often end up auditioning poorly. Therefore, it is important to discuss with them career paths and post-graduate work in each field. In <span class="entity">musical theater</span>, the BFA is the terminal degree.
			With a BFA degree, the srudents could go on to pursue an MFA degree in acting, directing, or voice and speech, which would then qualify them to join a university faculty. Some universities will accept musical theater students for the master of music in vocal performance or vocal pedagogy programs, but depending on their undergraduate  transcripts, may require them to take pre-requisite courses.
			For vocal performance majors, it is becoming rare to find employment without a graduate degree. Most singers interested in performance earn at least a master's degree, if not a doctorate. Some choose to pursue a master's degree in music education after having received a strong background in vocal technique. There are also opportunities to pursue music therapy and arts administration, both of which are degrees usually found in the school of music. Graduate degrees can also prepare students for faculty positions and private studio teaching.
			Students with an undergraduate  degree in any field can also pursue medical school, law school or an MBA degree. These programs often desire applicants with diverse backgrounds as a way to  encourage  outside-the-box thinking. The book A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future, by <span class="person">Daniel H. Pink</span>, provides compelling reasons parents should nor be afraid to allow their students to pursue the arts while developing their creativity.</p>

			<h4>Specific Considerations</h4>
			<h3>Musical Theater</h3>
			<p>If a singer is interested in <span class="entity">musical theater</span>, she should really have experience in dance and acting. With only 61 programs to choose from, students will likely find  there is a great deal of competition even for the lesser-known programs. Due to casting requirements, women are often expected to dance at a higher level than men. In highly competitive programs, if a student is  unable  to  keep  up with the group during the dance audition, it can severely handicap the scores and potentially affect the overall audition. As far as acting is concerned, it is not enough to simply memorize and recite a monologue.  Students should find a piece in which they can be invesred in rhe character and live truthfully in the moment. For a singing audition, musical theater students are expected to present a healthy vocal technique, but classical training is often not required.
			Students who belt should do so in their audition as long as  it does not sound out of control or damaged. </p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Vocal Performance</h3>
			<p>Vocal performance programs are interested in students who are seriously committed to pursuing classical vocal  performing opportunities. This is not a degree for people who like to sing for fun. As with musical theater, competition is often greater for women than men. Students should have voice lessons for at least a year before applying. Ideally, vocal training would begin the freshmen year of high school and focus on language and musicality while the voice is still young and maturing. For audition repertoire, students should focus on finding pieces that show  their  ability  to  perfect  the  nuances of the style. Audition panels do not expect to  hear  operatic arias at these auditions. In fact, they can be a major turn-off. Songs from collections of beginning-level repertoire are more than enough to show the panel the student's potential.
			Musical theater repertoire is usually inappropriate for a vocal performance audition. Since most programs require a music theory entrance exam, students should, at a minimum, also be able to read music in both clefs, write scales and analyze basic chords before auditioning.
			Regardless of which option they choose, there are a few audition tips that are universal and go a long way toward preparing the students to do their best.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Do Your Research</h3>
			<p>The first step is to find the right match for the student's personality, skills and ambitions. Students should begin assessing what it is they want out of a program  then seek out the programs that fulfill those desires. Do they want to be in a large school and have the "college experience," or would they prefer a small school? ls money a big consideration? Do they want to be in a small town or in a big city? How important are solo performing opportunities?
			Use these questions as a starting  point  to whittle  down the myriad choices that are available. The  application process can be lengthy and quite expensive, so it's important to narrow the field  before students start sending in  test scores and setting up auditions.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>When Possible, Go To On-Campus Auditions</h3>
			<p>We all know this can get quite expensive, especially when a student is applying to numerous programs, or when her top-choice school is far from home. But  it is truly in  the best interest of the students to visir the campuses for their auditions because it allows them to see first-hand the campus, its facilities and the surrounding area, as well as to attend classes and performances or rehearsals. In short, the student gets a chance to observe what it is they do at that school and further determine if it's the right match.
			Students need to realize that  they're  auditioning  the school as much as the school  is auditioning  them. The school needs to make a good impression as much as the student needs to impress the school. Encourage them to talk to current students, sit in on anything possible and really tour the campus to see if it feels like home. It doesn't matter how good a program's reputation is, if it isn't the right fit for the student who is going to attend, it's nor going to be a fruitful four-year experience.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Read The Audition Requirements Carefully</h3>
			<p>Of course it seems obvious to follow audition guidelines, but it is always amazing how many students do not. It is vitally importane that students follow the audition rules laid out by each program. When an audition date is established, the university will either refer the student to its website or send the student a list of requirements. DO NOT fly in the face of the requirements. No matter how talented the student is, it is a major turn-off  for schools when students do not follow the audition requirements. This might mean the student will have to learn a different piece for school "B" because that student's piece is on a "do not do" list or because their favorite song is from the wrong time period. Whatever it is, do it.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Choose Appropriate Material</h3>
			<h4>Musical Theater</h4>
			<p>Choose source material from published plays and musicals. Do not use self-written pieces or monologues that come from a collection of contentless pieces, the Internet, film, literature or television. For songs, avoid <span class="entity">non-musical theater material</span> unless specifically rold that other sources are okay.
			Find material that is age appropriate. This does not mean students need to perform only roles of 17- or 18-year-olds, but avoid pieces that  require a student  to  be a husband, wife, parent or grandparent.
			Avoid "performance pieces." Do not perform impassioned speeches about suicide, disease and death, or stand-up comedy routines. Instead, find pieces  that allow  the student  to be a character talking to another character with a clear objective and relationship.
			Find pieces and cuts that showcase the student's strengths and do not expose her weaknesses. fu faculty adjudicators, we just need to hear what she does well so we can assess our ability to train her for the business.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Vocal Performance</h3>
			<p>Sing age appropriate repertoire. No one expects a young performer to sing Verdi at  age 18. Look for art songs  that tell stories students can relate to or operetta characters that are dose to their age. Many of these can be found in the works of Gilbert and Sullivan and other late 19th- and early 20th-century composers.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Prepare Audition Music Properly</h3>
			<p>Most schools will provide an accompanist at the auditions. It is the student's responsibility to make sure he presents his music in an organized, professional way no loose sheets and no bound vocal selection books that won't stay open. Photocopy each song and place the music imagiare sheets in a three-ring binder.8 Be sure to clearly mark any changes for the accompanist.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Practice, Practice, Practice</h3>
			<p>Students must know all of their material inside and out, forward and backward. They must have played through their songs many times with a piano player, rather than a recording to make sure they know how it's going to sound when played by an accompanist. They must have spoken their monologues out loud, preferably with another person standing in as their scene partner. Do nor let them bring in material they have not tried before we promise you it will fail.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Dress Appropriately For The Audition </h3>
			<h4>Musical Theater</h4>
			<p>If there is a dance component to the audition, students should have dance attire to change it. Dancewear is best so faculty adjudicators can see the line and contours of the body as it moves through space. Women should bring both heels and flats, and men can be in ballet or jazz shoes-no street sneakers or socks.
			For the singing and acting portions of the audition, students should dress "business casual." Have them wear something that reflects who they are withour being either sloppy or overly formal. Women should nor wear cocktail or prom dresses, nor should they wear anything low-cut or too revealing. Dresses or pants/skirt and a blouse are fine. If a female wears a skirt or dress, just be sure that it extends at least to the knees. The student should be able to move in the clothing, including going to the floor if asked. Men may choose to wear nice jeans or slacks and a button-up shirt or a sweater. Tie and jacket are nor necessary, but dress shoes are preferable to sneakers or sandals.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Vocal Performance</h3>
			<p>Men should wear a suit and tie, or at least anice pair of dress slacks, a dress shirt and tie. Women should wear a dress and nice shoes wich a closed toe. Evening gowns and tuxedos are unnecessary and can come off as pretentious.
			For either: DO NOT wear high heels if you can't walk in them! We want to see che student's personality, so let chat inform che cloching choice. Also, make sure students hair is out of their faces. For women, that may mean clipping back bangs and tying back long hair.  For  men,  it might mean chey need a haircut before going to college auditions.  But we do not want the eyes obscured or shadowed by hair.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>OwnTheRoom</h3>
			<p>Remind che students  that this is their audition. One  of che things colleges look for in prospective students is confidence. When they walk into che  room,  they cannot  be meek and shy. Teach your students to: enter confidently and say hello to the people behind the table; show the panel their personality; be open to carrying on conversation if the faculty should start it. Ocherwise, students should simply move to the piano and get che audicion performance going.
			In a musical cheater audicion, if a student needs a chair and there's one in che room, he should feel free to use it rather than asking permission. When the student is ready and has che audition panel's attencion, he should take control and begin che audition instead of asking if he should start. Don't wait to be invited to command che room-just do it.
			The only warning in che room: do not go far a handshake. If the person  behind  the table stands up and offers his or her hand che student may approach, otherwise, stay away from the table.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Make The Strongest Acting Choices Possible</h3>
			<p>This goes for musical cheater and vocal performance. Opera is no longer a stand and sing art form, and students should have some comfort level with acting their songs.
			Students should be able to answer the  following  questions: Who are you? To whom are you speaking? What  is che specific nature of the relationship? What do you want from that person? If the student doesn't have che answers to these questions ready at che drop of a hat, he has not fully prepared.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3>Practice lnterview Skills</h3>
			<p>The final piece of the puzzle is mastering the interview. The students muse give some serious  thought  as  to why they want major in vocal performance  or musical  theater and why they want to study at the particular school they're audicioning for, because those questions are almost guaranteed. They should not talk about  how  they love  the sound of applause or how  they  want  to  be  on  <span class="place">Broadway</span> those are big turn-offs. When they are asked about why they want
			to study at a school, it helps if they bave a few really specific reasons for choosing that particular program.
			They should also come prepared to ask che audition panel a few questions of their own. Remember what was said earlier:
			They're audicioning the school as much as the school is auditioning them. This is just another way of looking more professional and prepared, and it will give your students an edge.
			Most importantly, teach students  to let their personality shine through in The interview process. He may be the most calenced person in the world, but if che audition panel doesn't detect a personality, or if they don't believe che student is going to be compatible with the faculty for the next four years, he will find himself rejected. Believe it or not, personality and energy count for a lot. Often times, the personality even helps weigh an otherwise less-chan-perfect audition. So teach your students to be themselves and try to enjoy the process.
			Although career counselor/audition coach may not be specified in your job description, a little knowledge and guidance can help your students go a long way. You are our first line of recruiting, which is why we love building relationships with private teachers and choral directors to make chose connections. If you have multiple students interested in specific programs, reach out and contact the admissions coordinator of that school on the phone or by e-mail. No one enjoys sitting chrough poor auditions and rejecting students, but it's an inevitable part of the process. However, by following these guidelines, we anticipate that you'll see your students' acceptance levels rise and rejection levels fall, which makes the whole process more enjoyable for everyone involved.</p>
