                <p id="abstract">The idea of combining virtual reality technology and theatrical tradition
                    to create virtual plays has captured artists’ imaginations for
                    some time. Using conventional technology, the use of virtual characters
                    in a theatrical performance often integrates the predefined
                    animations of virtual actors into the theater scene, resulting in a
                    performance that can feel stilted and unresponsive due to its preprogrammed
                    nature. This paper proposes a new system that allows
                    actors to animate virtual characters in real time, resulting in a more
                    flexible and interactive theatrical performance experience. Actors
                    are sequestered at a remote site, invisible to the audience, and are
                    digitized by a motion capture system. Using camera feeds to provide
                    the remote actors with information about the behavior of the
                    live actors and audience in the theater, the remote actors can adapt
                    their virtual counterparts’ behavior to react to live events in realtime,
                    giving the illusion to the audience that the virtual characters
                    are responsive to their actions. 
                    The system integrates display peripherals, networked cameras,
                    real-time motion capture system, gesture recognition, and a virtual
                    environment development suite (Virtools) to create a true virtual
                    theatrical performance environment. In the paper, we will present
                    the various concepts developed so far and an example of a virtual
                    theatrical performance called Trickster at the Intersection that was
                    presented during Smart Graphics 2010 at <span class="place">Canada’s Banff Centre</span>.</p>

                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Over the past decade, Virtual Reality (VR) have been used in a
                wide range of artistic applications including virtual theater. Virtual
                theater preserves the theatrical performance form through direct
                mediated interaction of avatars and objects, and it is known
                for its flexibility of interaction <a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">[1]</a>, and its potential to create novel
                theatrical elements <a class="biblioRef" href="#b19">[19]</a> that would be impossible to do in the realworld.
                However, performances in virtual theater are often prerecorded
                which make them pre-programmed, difficult to use, and
                lifeless compared to the spontaneity and improvisation of a real
                performance.</p>
                <p>This paper presents a new system that preserves the interactivity
                    of real theater by allowing for a better sense of presence and
                    the ability of improvisation. The system features immersive display
                    peripherals used as part of the theatrical set, networked cameras,
                    real-time motion capture and gesture recognition, integrated
                    into a virtual environment development suite (Virtools). The system
                    allows natural interaction between the audience and the virtual
                    characters without the aid of tethered input devices. In the current
                    system, the audience can view the virtual actor in an immersive
                    three-wall CAVE (see Figure 1(a)) to interact with a remote actor
                    digitized in real-time by a motion capture system (Figure 1(b)) allowing
                    the actor to control an avatar (see Figure 1(c)) and to create
                    actions in the virtual world using gesture. While the audience does
                    not know that the virtual character is controlled by a remote actor,
                    the remote actor can see and listen in real time to the audience
                    and other actors located on the real theater set by using networked
                    cameras and microphones.</p>
                <p>One of the key component of the system is the use of gesture
                    recognition technology to create actions in the virtual world. For
                    example, as the actor performs his/her gestures, one can create actions
                    that materialize objects, stretch objects, turn them transparent
                    or appear/disappear, and emit sparkles etc. In many ways, many
                    gesture-triggered special effects can be created depending on the
                    scenario of the play. By using gesture recognition based only on
                    the actor’s motion, one can smoothly integrate actions into the performance,
                    making each performance a unique experience that can
                    be controlled by the subtlety of the human actor and the reaction
                    of the audience. In addition, remote cameras on the audience side
                    can be used by the actor to observe the participant and to give them </p>

            <p id="methodSummary"><span class="label">Methods: </span>A previously described adult ureteroscopy and renoscopy simulator (Ideal Anatomic) was modified and remolded to function as a patient surrogate. Three renal calculi of different sizes from the patient who provided the original computed tomographic urograph on which the simulator was based were used. The renal calculi were suspended in urine in the model and taken for 20 rides on the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The roller coaster rides were analyzed using variables of renal calculi volume, calyceal location, model position on the roller coaster, and renal calculi passage.</p>

Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, front seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 4 of 24. Independent of renal calculi volume and calyceal location, rear seating on the roller coaster resulted in a passage rate of 23 of 36. Independent of renal calculi volume in rear seating, calyceal location differed in passage rates, with an upper calyceal calculi passage rate of 100%; a middle calyceal passage rate of 55.6%; and a lower calyceal passage rate of 40.0%.</p>
            <p id="conclusionSummary"><span class="label">Conclusion: </span>The functional pyelocalyceal renal model serves as a functional patient surrogate to evaluate activities that facilitate calyceal renal calculi passage. The rear seating position on the roller coaster led to the most renal calculi passages.</p>

        <section id="Introduction">
            <p>In the United States each year, more than 300,000 patients seek emergency department care for kidney stones, or renal calculi. <a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> Patient positional inversion, hydration, and external application of force to the body wall has been used to facilitate renal calculi</p>
            <p>passage with variable success.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b02">2</a>-<a class="biblioRef" href="#b05">5</a> Reports of spontaneous renal calculi passage associated with bungee cord jumping and roller coaster riding have been published in the foreign lay press.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b06">6</a> The lifetime prevalence of kidney stones in men is approximately 11% and in women, 6%.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a></p>
            <p>Over several years, a notable number of our patients reported passing renal calculi spontaneously after riding the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad roller coaster at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida. The number of stone passages was sufficient to raise suspicions of a possible link between riding a roller coaster and passing renal calculi. One patient reported passing renal calculi after each of 3 consecutive rides on the roller coaster. Many patients reported passing renal calculi within hours of leaving the amusement park, and all of them rode the same roller coaster during their visit.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the current study was to validate this functional pyelocalyceal renal model and to provide clinical recommendations based on data generated.</p>
