 began looking into the possibility of an American tour.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b05">5</a> When <a href="https://it.findagrave.com/memorial/185537879/addie-kahn" target="_blank"><span class="person">Addie Kahn</span></a> (the wife of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hermann_Kahn" target="_blank"><span class="person">Otto Kahn</span></a>, the chairman of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Metropolitan Opera</span></a>'s board of directors) threw her support behind the idea, a

 her the role of prima ballerina.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b10">10</a> Although initially interested, <span class="person">Spessivtzeva</span> was convinced by critic <span class="person">Akin Volinsky</span>, who disapproved of

         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> agreed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> would not be required to appear in
         more than two performances per evening. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> also agreed that
         daytime performances were to be held only once a week, during which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> would be required to dance only one ballet.</li>
         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> agreed that the contract could be extended

         <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> agreed to forfeit 100 rubles if she failed to attend a daytime
         performance.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b21">21</a></li>
       </ol>
     <p>Now that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> had his prima ballerina, he assembled the rest
 of the troupe and began rehearsals.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b22">22</a> In <time datetime="1916-12">December 1915</time>, the company gave two European charity performances.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b23">23</a> With the shows
 having garnered superb reviews,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b24">24</a> the company set sail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux" target="_blank"><span class="place">Bordeaux</span></a> on <time datetime="1916-01-01">January 1,1916</time> in high spirits.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b25">25</a></p>
     <p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a>, the company's first performance took place on <time datetime="1916-01-17">Monday, January 17</time>, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Theatre_(New_York_City)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Century Theatre</span></a>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b26">26</a> For months, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays" target="_blank"><span class="person">Edward L. Bernays</span></a>, the <span class="entity">Met's press</span> agent, had been whetting the public's appetite by filling countless magazines and newspapers with stories
 about the company's arrival,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b27">27</a> and throughout the country manufacturers had been churning out products based on the company's
 distinctive costumes.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b28">28</a> But this massive advertising campaign had
 raised expectations too high, especially because it had been built
 around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaslav_Nijinsky" target="_blank"><span class="person">Nijinsky</span></a> and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamara_Platonovna_Karsavina" target="_blank"><span class="person">Karsavin</span></a>, neither of whom was with the tour.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b29">29</a>
 As a result, the opening night reviews were brutal, with most of the
 criticism aimed squarely at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b30">30</a> As one observer succinctly
 put it, "the weakest point of 'The Firebird' was the bird herself."<a class="biblioRef" href="#b31">31</a></p>
     <p>On the other hand, audiences could not get enough of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>'s fellow dancer <span class="person">Lydia Lopokova</span><a class="biblioRef" href="#b32">32</a> and openly wondered why
 she did not have a bigger role.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b33">33</a> As if this was not bad enough, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> found himself under constant attack by conservatives, who
 accused him of obscenity, especially when the company performed <i><a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q3959895" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Schéhérazade</span></a></i> (which many felt promoted miscegenation).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b34">34</a></p>
     <p>On <time datetime="1916-01-29">Saturday, January 29</time>, the company gave its final <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a>
 performance and moved on to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" target="_blank"><span class="place">Boston</span></a>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b35">35</a> Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> was
 hopeful that the tour would now go better, things actually got much worse.</p>

 curtain rose, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> was asked to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> instead of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval_(ballet)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Carnival</span></a></em>. Although she had done so in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b37">37</a> she now refused unless she was paid an extra $150.

 incident, during which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> insisted that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> had orally
 agreed to change paragraph 2 of her contract to include <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b38">38</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> disagreed, insisting that the pair had

      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>'s unwillingness to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em>

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> had finally had enough. On <time datetime="1916-02-02">Wednesday, February 2</time>, he
 fired her and gave her roles to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Lopokova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Lopokova</span></a>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b40">40</a></p>
     <p>Upon learning that she had been terminated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> tried
 to have the police arrest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b41">41</a> When this attempt failed, she
 went to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Russian_consulate&redirect=no" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Russian consulate</span></a>, where she was similarly rebuffed.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b42">42</a>
 Undaunted, she hired a local attorney named <span class="person">Joseph Michelman</span>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b43">43</a>
 who promptly filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b44">44</a>
 In his countersuit, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> claimed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>'s insubordination had left him with no choice but to replace her.</p>
     <p>The case was assigned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Chase" target="_blank"><span class="person">Judge Frederic H. Chase</span></a> of the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/locations/suffolk-county-superior-court" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Suffolk
 County Superior Court</span></a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" target="_blank"><span class="place">Boston</span></a>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b45">45</a> who announced the trial would begin on <time datetime="1916-04-11">April 11, 1916</time>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b46">46</a> On <time datetime="1916-04-12">Wednesday, April 12</time>, the beautiful,
 dark-skinned, well-dressed<a class="biblioRef" href="#b47">47</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> took the stand and captivated the courtroom with her version of what had happened.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b48">48</a></p>
     <p>At the conclusion of the evidence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Chase" target="_blank"><span class="person">Judge Chase</span></a> instructed the
 jury to determine:</p>
       <ol>
         <li>if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> had amended paragraph 2 of their original contract to include <span class="person">The Enchanted Princess</span>;and, </li>
         <li>whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>'s refusal to dance with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> had been justified.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b49">49</a></li>
      </ol>
 <p>Answering these questions "no" and "yes," the jury awarded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> $4,500.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b50">50</a>

      <h2> IV-Rewriting History</h2>
      <p> The relationship between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> was destined
 to end in conflict. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> was an outspoken woman who
 loved being the center of attention and jealously guarded her prerogatives,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b51">51</a>
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> had a well-earned reputation for being demanding and difficult.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b52">52</a></p>
     <p>Although they had gotten along in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank"><span class="place">Europe</span></a>, they came to blows
 almost as soon as they arrived in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"><span class="place">United States</span></a>. Indeed, during
 one of the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a> performances, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>, already in
 costume and five minutes from going on, threatened to walk out
 and relented only after a great deal of coaxing.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b53">53</a></p>
     <p>It was while they were in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a>
 first discussed substituting <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> for <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval_(ballet)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Carnival</span></a></em>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b54">54</a>
 When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> agreed to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> during
 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a> opening, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> thought that they had reached an
 agreement for the entire tour. As a result, he scheduled her to perform it again at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" target="_blank"><span class="place">Boston</span></a> opening.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b55">55</a></p>
     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> later claimed she did not know she would be performing <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> until the morning of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" target="_blank"><span class="place">Boston</span></a>
 opening. Even if true,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b56">56</a> it is interesting that she waited until 6:30
 p.m. to discuss the matter with <span class="person">Grigoriev</span>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b57">57</a> Moreover, at 9:00 p.m.,
 just 10 minutes before <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> was scheduled to
 begin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> told <span class="person">Randolfo Barocchi</span>, the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Met</span></a>'s financial
 manager, that unless he immediately brought $150 to her dressing
 room she would not go on.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b58">58</a> Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> knew that with a
 full house and no one to replace her, <span class="person">Barocchi</span> would have to comply.</p>
     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> also testified that she was reluctant to perform <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" target="_blank"><span class="place">Boston</span></a> because she had injured her toes (an
 explanation she was forced to back away from during cross-examination).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b59">59</a> In fact, after dancing <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" target="_blank"><span class="place">New York</span></a> opening, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> had consulted <span class="person">Victor E. Gartz</span>, an attorney
 whose clients included members of the Russian royal family.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b60">60</a> He advised her that her recent actions had not vitiated the contract,
 and that she was therefore free to turn down future requests to dance <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em>.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b61">61</a> Of course, in front of the jury <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> sought to downplay the importance of her visit to <span class="person">Gartz</span> (as
 well as gain sympathy) by claiming she was injured.</p>
     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a>'s testimony regarding her refusal to perform with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> was even more outrageous:</p>
       <ol>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> claimed that <span class="person">Gavriloff</span> was unsuitable because he was an ensemble member rather than a featured player,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b62">62</a> but later admitted he
        had performed <em><span class="entity">The Enchanted Princess</span></em> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Lopokova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Lopokova</span></a> and others.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b63">63</a> In
        addition, <span class="person">Gavriloff</span>, who had trained at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariinsky_Ballet" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Maryinsky Ballet</span></a> and joined
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballets_Russes" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Les Ballets Russes</span></a> in 1911,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b64">64</a> was considered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> to be talented
        enough to serve as one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaslav_Nijinsky" target="_blank"><span class="person">Nijinsky</span></a>'s understudies.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b65">65</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> said she was afraid she would be injured if she had to dance
         with <span class="person">Gavriloff</span>, but let <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> know she would be willing to do so if he
         paid her extra.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b66">66</a> Indeed, throughout her time with the company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> repeatedly badgered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> for money, which suggests she either had very expensive tastes or very large debts (or both).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b67">67</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Makletzova</span></a> claimed that she was asked to dance with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Diaghilev" target="_blank"><span class="person">Diaghileff</span></a> without
         being given time to rehearse with him. In fact, however, she had repeatedly turned down his practice requests.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b68">68</a></li>

      <h2> V-Conclusion </h2>
      <p class="footer"> With the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that the jury reached the wrong verdict. On stage, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenia_Makletzova" target="_blank"><span class="person">Xenia Makletzova</span></a> was merely an average dancer. In court, however, she was an undeniable star.</p>

Makletzova had sought to have her damages fixed at 18,500 rubles, the amount specified in paragraph 7 of the contract. As explained <em>supra</em> note 20, this would have been the equivalent of $9,500. The court found this figure to be so far in excess of Makletzova's actual damages that it deemed the paragraph an unenforceable penalty. <em>Makletzova</em>, 116 N.E. at 233.
      It is not clear how the jury came up with $4,500. Indeed, having been terminated three months early, it would seem that Makletzova was entitled to $6,500 (4,250 rubles per month for three months converted at an exchange rate of 1 ruble to $0.51).</p>
