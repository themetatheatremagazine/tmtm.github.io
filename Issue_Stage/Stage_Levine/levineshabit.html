      <section id="Introduction">
        <p class="capital">Director and performance-based visual artist <span class="person">David Levine</span> opened his <time datetime="2006">2006</time> essay "<span class="entity">Bad Art and Objecthood</span>" (a response to <span class="person">Michael Fried</span>'s
        <time datetime="1967">1967</time> essay "<span class="entity">Art and Objecthood</span>") with
        this quote from <span class="person">Chris Burden</span>: "It seems that
        bad art is theatre...Getting shot is for real...
        there's no element of pretense or make-believe
        in it" (in <span class="person">Levine</span> <time datetime="2006">2006</time>:22).<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a>
        In his <time datetime="2012">2012</time> production, <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>, <span class="person">Levine</span> continued his engagement
        with <span class="person">Burden</span>'s provocative assertion that "bad
        art is theatre" but this time with a full-scale
        production of <span class="person">Jason Grote</span>'s 90-minute play, <em><span class="entity">The Children of Kings</span></em>,
        staged inside a replica
        of a suburban ranch house built within
        <span class="place">New York City</span>'s <span class="place">Essex Street Market</span>. The performance was part of the <span class="entity">French Institute Alliance
        Frangaise</span>'s <em><span class="entity">Crossing the Line Festival</span></em> (coproduced with <span class="entity">PS122</span> and funded in part by a <!--Cosa è Li?ie-->
        <span class="entity">Kickstarter</span> campaign), and it was free and open
        to the public. No tickets were required. Two
        rotating casts of three characters performed the
        play on alternating days, nonstop, eight hours a
        day for ten days straight. For the performance's
        duration, the actors never left the set, which
        meant they had to take care of their emotional
        and biological needs while also attending to the
        circumstances of the written drama.</p>

        <p>With this production, as in his <time datetime="2006">2006</time> essay,
        <span class="person">Levine</span> seems to be challenging the same
        notion of theatre that compelled <span class="person">Burden</span> to
        make his famous and provocative <time datetime="1971">1971</time> performance piece,<em><span class="entity">Shoot</span></em>, in which <span class="person">Burden</span>'s assistant
        shot him in the left arm. Theatre is pretense.
        Getting shot is real. But to limit the questions <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> poses to how events framed as theatre
        can simultaneously be real and authentic would
        be too reductive, and, more importantly, it
        would overlook the range of additional questions <span class="person">Levine</span> puts into play, such as: Is this a
        work of art about theatre, about experimenting and violating its rituals? Or is this theatre
        grappling with its objectness, its refusal of the
        conditions that make theatre, as <span class="person">Michael Fried</span>
        wrote, "bad art"?</p>

        <p><span class="person">Levine</span> first conceived <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> in <time datetime="2005">2005</time> as he
        began his move away from theatre and into
        visual arts performance. The questions <span class="entity">Habit</span>
        asks seem to come from <span class="person">Levine</span>'s desire to
        complicate habits of theatre-making by experimenting with form and ritual. He explores
        the essence of theatre by removing the signs
        that help define it as such by, for example,
        enclosing actors within a plywood box (<em><span class="entity">'Night,
        Motherfucker</span></em> [<time datetime="2004">2004</time>])<a class="biblioRef" href="#b02">2</a> or, as in <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>, by staging
        the performance in a museum, gallery, or
        warehouse and not in a conventional theatre
        space (<em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> was developed at <span class="person">Robert Wilson</span>'s
        <span class="entity">Watermill Center</span> in <time datetime="2010">2010</time> and at <span class="entity">MASS MoCA</span>
        in <time datetime="2011">2011</time>). This removing and relocating asks us
        to consider if what is left is indeed still theatre.
        In <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>, <span class="person">Levine</span> thinks through "habits of realism, or what our habitual mode of realism is,
        or American theatre's habit of producing the
        same play over and over again" (in <span class="person">Katz</span> <time datetime="2012">2012</time>).
        He commissioned downtown playwright <span class="person">Jason
        Grote</span> (who was also a television writer for the
        first season of <em><span class="entity">Smash</span></em>) to compose a script that
        employed standard tropes and formulas of contemporary American realism exemplified in the
        works of playwrights such as <span class="person">Adam Rapp</span>,
        <span class="person">Neil LaBute</span>, and <span class="person">Sam Shepard</span>: a suburban setting,
        a small cast of working-class characters, drug/
        alcohol abuse, and a secret that when revealed
        has catastrophic consequences. <span class="person">Grote</span>'s play,
        initially named <em>Half-Moon Mirror</em>, a
        title that <span class="person">Levine</span> says recalls in style,
        theme, and title <span class="person">Adam Rapp</span>'s play
        <em><span class="entity">Red Light Winter</span></em>, and then changed
        to <em><span class="entity">The Children of Kings</span></em>, is about
        two drug-addled brothers, <span class="person">Mitch</span>
        and <span class="person">Doug</span>, who harbor a dark secret
        that, until the end of the play, they
        hide from their roommate, <span class="person">Viv</span>,
        a failed sociology grad student
        turned-stripper (<span class="person">Holzapfel</span> <time datetime="2012">2012</time>).</p>

        <p>In addition to examining genre,
        <span class="person">Levine</span> also experiments with acting as both a job and a craft.
        Prior to <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>, <span class="person">Levine</span> composed
        a <time datetime="2007">2007</time> piece called <em><span class="entity">Actors at Work</span></em>
        in which he hired actors under
        Actors' Equity contracts to continue working at their day jobs in
        order to reframe these jobs as theatrical employment. In his <time datetime="2007">2007</time>
        <em><span class="entity">Bauerntheater</span></em> (<span class="entity">Farmers' Theatre</span>)
        project, <span class="person">Levine</span> and actor <span class="person">David Barlow</span>
         rehearsed <span class="person">Heiner Miiller</span>'s play <em><span class="entity">Die
        Umsiedlerin</span></em> (<time datetime="1961">1961</time>), but instead of performing
        the play, <span class="person">Levine</span> invited audiences to a field two
        hours outside of <span class="place">Berlin</span>, in the <span class="place">East German
        region of Brandenburg</span>, to watch <span class="person">Barlow</span>—who
        played the leading role, a communist farmer
        named "<span class="person">Flint</span>"—tend potatoes using traditional
        methods taught to him by <span class="person">Eckhardt Schlestein</span>,
        an actual potato farmer. When describing this
        performance in a <time datetime="2008">2008</time> <span class="entity">TDR</span> article, <span class="person">Marvin Carlson</span>
        invoked <span class="person">Michael Kirby</span>'s theories of
        matrixed and nonmatrixed performance. He
        wrote that <span class="person">Levine</span>'s intention with the piece
        short-circuited "the distinction between the
        real-life action of the Happening and the
        matrixed action of the theatre," an objective
        that is also at play in <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> (<time datetime="2008">2008</time>:36).</p>

        <p><span class="person">Levine</span> complicates the ways the audience
        reads the signs (the matrixes) that help viewers
        determine what is or is not theatre. In <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>,
        <span class="person">Levine</span> worked with two rotating casts of three
        actors who performed for the duration of the
        performance (eight hours) within the set and
        without ever leaving. During that time the
        actors had to negotiate their own needs with
        those of the characters. As <span class="person">Levine</span> put it, "I'm
        more interested in the job of being in character and the solutions you find to that" (in <span class="person">Katz</span>
        <time datetime="2012">2012</time>). This postulation draws attention to the
        conciliations actors are always making between
        their own needs or wants (hunger, sleepiness,
        the desire to impress a cast mate or an audi
        ence member...etc.) with the performance's
        needs. <span class="person">Levine</span>'s set-up
        made these negotiations all the more central, because
        in addition to their emotional needs/wants, the actors
        also had to contend with their biological ones.
        <span class="person">Levine</span> described this layering of the actors'
        experiences with those of the characters — also
        a tenet of <span class="person">Lee Strasberg</span>'s acting method — as
        "not so much rejecting realism as wanting to
        provide actors with a platform to rock the fuck
        out on a style" (in <span class="person">Holzapfel</span> <time datetime="2012">2012</time>).</p>

      <section id="My_habits">
        <h2>My Habits</h2>
        <p>I went to <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> on Tuesday afternoon <time datetime="2012-09-25">September 25th</time> at around 3:30 p.m. I read on the
        <span class="entity">Crossing the Line Festival</span>'s website that the
        performance ran from 1:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.,
        and I knew from the description that the actors
        would be performing the same text over and
        over during the allotted time: "Within a four
        walled, fully furnished and functional American
        ranch house (stocked refrigerator, working
        stove, plumbing, running water), three actors
        perform a 90-minute drama on a continuous
        loop for eight hours a day" (<span class="entity">FIAF</span> <time datetime="2012">2012</time>). When
        I arrived, the door to the <span class="place">Essex Street Market
        Building B</span> was open. The only indication that
        a performance was going on was a small sign
        advertising the festival standing on the side
        walk outside the entrance. Just inside a woman
        was stationed at an information table covered
        with pamphlets detailing the other festival performances, and just beyond her, in the center of
        the cavernous industrial space, was the set.</p>

        <p>From the outside, the set looked like a construction site, and I had the feeling of being
        inside a television studio. The only parts of
        television studio sets that are decorated are
        the ones that appear on camera, so the exteriors and backsides of the walls are left raw
        and unfinished. The same went for <span class="person">Marsha
        Ginsberg</span>'s design. Only the inside of the set
        resembled a home, so the incoming audience
        was first confronted by the rough exterior, a
        persistent reminder that the barriers separating the actors' world and the audience's were
        built by designers for this performance event,
        not by a construction crew building a home.
        <span class="person">Ginsberg</span>'s design immediately helped frame
        the events inside as theatrical.</p>

        <p>To see inside, visitors gathered by the windows like moths towards light. The interior
        of the four-walled structure was the actors'
        domain, and the space outside of it, the audience's. The actors never left their quarters, and
        from what I observed, the audiences always
        stayed outside in theirs. The area surrounding the set was a between-zone (between the
        street outside and the playing space) where visitors could talk to each other, make phone calls,
        eat, sit on a bench, read, tend to their children, peer in through windows—whatever they
        wanted to do. This space was unstructured,
        open, and unchoreographed. Inside, the actors
        spoke <span class="person">Grote</span>'s text,
        but they were free to wander from room to room,
        eat, cook, piss, shower,
        shit, nap — as long as these actions also worked
        to advance the plot. While there was action
        going on outside the set, the kind of action akin
        to the behavior of museumgoers — meandering,
        chatting, texting, children crying—the dramatic
        action took place within it. The structure's
         central location, like the nucleus of a
        cell, demarcated the playing space as the center
        of this performance universe. Concurrently,
        the area surrounding the set was like the margin
        on a piece of lined paper, and the audience
        was the doodles and jottings that were
        not critical to the content, but evidenced the
        wandering thoughts, the needed time-outs, and
        the creative explorations that existed simultaneously—
        sometimes distracting from the content
       and sometimes complementing it.</p>

       </figure>

       <p>The staging also brought to mind another
       analogy: While peering through the kitchen
       window at the character <span class="person">Viv</span> giving <span class="person">Mitch</span> a lap
       dance, I had the memory of standing in front of
       the Bonobo monkey habitat at the <span class="place">San Diego
       Zoo</span>. Visitors wandered at will up to the window
       to watch the animals in captivity have
       sex, eat bananas, climb trees, fight, and go to
       the bathroom all while caged inside a space
       designed to resemble their natural habitat, the
       lowland rainforest in the <span class="place">Democratic Republic
       of Congo</span>. <span class="person">Ginsberg</span>'s
       set was a kind of habitat for realism's stock characters
       (two sparring, drug addicted brothers harboring a secret
       and the young, sexually charged woman who
       pits the brothers against each other), and we,
       the audience/visitors/tourists/curious wanderers
       were free to study these characters at no
       charge. During that time, the actors performed
       <span class="person">Grote</span>'s text and went through their routines,
       whether or not anyone was watching—just like
       animals at the zoo.</p>

       <p>This design produced a greater-than
       normal distance between actors and audience,
       even though, on its face, the concept seemed
       akin to the kind of immersive theatre experiences
       that have recently become fashionable in
       <span class="place">New York City</span> such as <span class="person">Punchdrunk</span>'s <em><span class="entity">Sleep No
       More</span></em> (<time datetime="2011">2011</time>-ongoing), <span class="person">Dave Malloy</span>'s <em><span class="entity">Natasha,
       Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812</span></em> (<time datetime="2012">2012</time>-<time datetime="2014">2014</time>),
       and <span class="entity">Third Rail Projects</span>' <em><span class="entity">Then She Fell</span></em> (<time datetime="2012">2012</time>-
       ongoing). However, while these shows bring
       the audiences into the performance, <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>
       excluded the audience from it. The way the
       actors seemed unaffected by the audience, even
       when they were only inches from their faces,
       and the way they roamed from room to room
       and sometimes to areas beyond the audience's
       sight lines as if it did not matter what the audience
       could or could not see, magnified the separation
       between audience and performer—and
       not just geographically, but also psychologically.
       Being ignored and physically blocked from
       them was alienating, and, in my experience,
       the staging compromised the give and take
       so essential to the theatrical experience. <span class="person">Jerzy Grotowski</span>
       wrote that theatre can exist with
       out makeup, costumes, stage lights, and sets,
       but the one thing it cannot "live" without is
       "the actor-spectator relationship of perceptual,
       direct, 'live' communion" ([<time datetime="1968">1968</time>] <time datetime="2012">2012</time>:19). The
       absence of this "communion" felt very much
       a part of <span class="person">Levine</span>'s experiment in non-theatre
       theatre. <span class="person">Levine</span> described this as the anti-the
       atrical part of the performance: "I finally man
       aged to create this anti-<span class="person">Fried</span> piece of theatre,
       which actually doesn't need you to complete it
       because it'll do its own thing no matter what
       [...] It's like, 'Oh yeah, it'll run...it's a machine...
       it turns, we don't have to be there...It'll just
       keep going in there all day'" (in <span class="person">Holzapfel</span>
       <time datetime="2012">2012</time>:107). So if, as <span class="person">Fried</span> believed, bad art is
       theatre because it panders to and depends on
       an audience, then <span class="person">Levine</span> resists this interpretation by trying to make a performance that goes
       on (and on) with or without one.</p>

      <section id="Habits_of_viewing">
        <h2>Habits of Viewing</h2>
        <p>When I arrived at <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>, the actors had already
        completed a quarter of the script. Of course,
        I would not discover this until the
        play came to its end. I knew it was
        the end because all the characters
        had been shot—but not like when
        <span class="person">Burden</span> was shot. The actors had
        succumbed to the pretense of being
        shot, to a fake gun jerked up and a
        loud bang, and were hunched over
        themselves on the bedroom floor,
        on the bathroom floor, and on the
        bed. They stayed like this for several minutes until
        <span class="person">Mitch</span> "woke up," the first action at the beginning
        of the play, as if nothing had
        happened, and began the run again.
        After about 15 minutes the play
        felt familiar, and I knew the actors
        had reached the same place in the
        text as when I arrived. At this point
        the experience shifted to one layered
        with my memory of that first
        watching, and I stayed a few more
        minutes before taking a break on one of the
        benches.</p>

        <p>Though the audience had to move around
        the set in order to follow the action, <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> was
        less about the exchange of space, and more
        about the exchange of attention from the
        actors' actions to the audiences'. In the same
        way one can only watch the Bonobo monkeys
        for so long before staring instead at the reflection
        of the other visitors watching the monkeys,
        during <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> my interest wandered from
        the inside of the set to a young man resting
        against the kitchen door entrance. He looked
        exhausted, and he struggled to keep his eyes
        open. They would close, and then he would
        jerk awake, then his eyes would droop, his body
        would sway, his eyes would close, and he would
        jerk awake, and so on and so forth. Framed by
        the doorway, this young man's performance
        marked a stark contrast to the actors' behavior.</p>

        <p>While the actors performed snorting
        cocaine, sleeping, and dying this young man
        was actually falling asleep, teetering forward
        and back, threatening to fall over into the
        set. I never once felt concern for the actors,
        even as they pointed a gun at each other, but
        as the young man swayed forward I felt the
        urge to rush across the warehouse to keep him
        upright. <span class="person">Levine</span>'s project
        created an environment in which audiences became voyeurs who
        watched actors, confined within a set,
        coping with performing the same drama over and
        over again for eight hours. However, this configuration made the performers' actions feel
        more hyperreal than real—always mediated
        through the lens of "this is for show." Intended
        or not, the performance succumbed to what I
        call the "Reality TV effect," a skeptical frame
        of reference through which viewers consider the
        "authentic" as staged, much like reality
        TV—scripted, but not totally. (It is quite
        apropos that on the <span class="entity">Kickstarter</span> page the show
        was billed as "<em>The Real World</em> meets <em>No Exit</em>"
        [<span class="entity">Kickstarter</span> <time datetime="2012">2012</time>].) So when looking for performances
        with consequence, performances
        that could threaten or disrupt the flow of the
        piece because of their inescapable realness, I
        located the young man against the doorframe
        who might have, at any point, tumbled into
        the house. He was not one of <span class="person">Levine</span>'s hired
        actors, but in that moment he was as much a
        part of <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> as they were. The conditions of
        the performance invited this analysis, so I feel
        at liberty to discuss the slumbering man's per
        formance alongside those of <span class="person">Mitch</span>, <span class="person">Viv</span>, and
        <span class="person">Doug</span>. I would like to think that this impulse
        to study other audience members as one would
        the characters is part of <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>'s challenge. In
        other words, the piece makes us consider our
        habits of viewing and spectatorship. It also con
        fronts our habits of perception—how we perceive
        and interpret something to be or not to
        be theatre.</p>

        <h2>Habits of Perceiving</h2>
        <p>How do I understand my experience of <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>?
        In many ways, the signs point to theatre: The
        performance had a script, a creative staff, hired
        actors, publicity, a set, a time frame, and a
        glowing <span class="person">Ben Brantley</span> review in the <em><span class="entity">New York
        Times</span></em> theatre section. However, <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> was
        void of many elements I love to experience
        when attending a theatre event: the live communion
        between actors and audiences and its
        transportive potential. <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> was cold theatre,
        cut off from the heat generated when people
        share a space in order to <em>do</em> theatre together.
        In "<span class="entity">Dramaturgy of the Spectator</span>", <span class="person">Marco De
        Marinis</span> wrote: "Through its actions, by putting
        to work a range of definite semiotic strategies, the performance seeks to induce in
        each spectator a range of definite transformations,
         both intellectual (cognitive) and affective
         (ideas, beliefs, emotions, fantasies, values,
        etc.)" (<time datetime="1987">1987</time>:101). Watching <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em>, I didn't feel
        like the objective of the director and performers
        was to do anything <em>with</em> me. This is not to
        say <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> was not affective; I certainly experienced
        a range of emotions and thoughts while
        at the performance. But the impact was almost
        in spite of the insularity of the performance.
        As such, I felt encouraged to back away, to stay
        outside the house and study the performance
        from a distance, much like I would a sculpture
        at a museum or gallery.</p>

        <p>Perhaps this is why the pleasure I derived
        from <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> has grown in the days since seeing
        it. During this period of reflection I have
        not only enjoyed grappling with the conceptual
        questions <span class="person">Levine</span> set in motion, but I have
        also been able to project myself inside the walls
        of <span class="person">Ginsberg</span>'s set, where
        I imaginatively experience the intimacy I sought while in the <span class="place">Essex Street Market</span>. In other words, <span class="person">Levine</span>'s piece
        has made me consider the fundamental reasons
        why I love theatre—my own habits of enjoyment.
        So while <em><span class="entity">Habit</span></em> may have pushed against
        several of these by insisting on its self-sufficiency,
        an appreciation for these elements has
        been lit anew.</p>
