        <p id="objectivesAbstract"> <span class="label">Objectives</span>-To obtain more information
        about injuries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> performers.</p>
        <p id="methodsAbstract"> <span class="label">Methods</span>-A retrospective survey of 269
        performers appearing in 20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> productions
        (12 dramas and eight musicals).
        <span class="label">Results</span>- In current productions, 46% of
        all performers sustained at least one
        injury for an average of 0.87 injuries per
        performer. Lower extremity injuries were
        the most common for dancers (52.2% of
        injuries) and actors (43.2%) with neck and
        back injuries the second most common.
        Sprains and strains were the most com
        mon diagnoses. 61% of performers
        thought that their injuries were prevent
        able. Most performers consulted non
        physician healthcare providers. Factors
        significantly influencing the risk of inju
        ries for performers include female sex, a
        history of previous injuries, missed per
        formances due to previous injuries, more
        physically demanding roles, and perform
        ing on raked (angled) stages.</p>
        <p id="conclusionAbstract"> <span class="label">Conclusion</span>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> performers com
        monly sustain injuries. Although primary
        prevention of most theatrical injuries is
        not possible, modification of raked stages
        may reduce the incidence. This study may
        be helpful to the growing number of
        healthcare providers who practice per
        forming arts medicine and may stimulate
        additional concern and research in the
        medical and theatrical communities
        about the performance injuries of profes
        sionals, amateurs, and theatrical students
        worldwide.</p>

      <section id="Introduction">
        <p>For the audience, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> productions can
         offer insightful and witty dialogue, inspiring
         and enthralling music, and seemingly effort
         less, dazzling dancing by some of the world's
         outstanding performers. Behind the glamour
         and glitz, however, is a highly stressful
         workplace where the performers can sustain a
         variety of occupational injuries. After our
         recent study on the prevalence and risk factors
         for theatrical injuries in 23 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a>
         companies,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> we performed a similar survey of
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> companies.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="Methods">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>Sampling</h3>
          <p>The study was performed with the cooperation
           of the staff and members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(British_trade_union)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">British Actors' Equity Association</span></a> who selected 20 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a>
           theatrical productions in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" target="_blank"><span class="place">London</span></a> chosen for a
           mixture of dramas and musicals for the survey
           (table 1). The productions are 12 dramas and
           eight musicals.The deputy of each company
           distributed the survey to all cast members on
           various dates in <time datetime="1996-02">February 1996</time>. An attached
           letter from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(British_trade_union)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Association</span></a> introduced and
           endorsed the survey. The respondent could
           either mail in their anonymously completed
           questionnaire to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(British_trade_union)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Association</span></a> or give it to
           the deputy to send in. The number of respond
           ents was 269 out of 379 total cast members
           (71%).</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Sources of error and bias</h3>
          <p>Retrospective surveys of injury, including this
          one, present potential problems with the accuracy
          of the respondents' recollections. As theiroccupations are at risk, professional performers
          may be especially likely to remember their
          injuries.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> Additionally, the assurance of
          anonymity may also have encouraged candor in the
          responses. The injury rate may be slightly
          higher than described as disabled performers
          were not included in the survey. About five to
          10 performers a year in all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a>
          productions are disabled from injuries and not
          able to complete their contracts.</p>
          <p>The overall response rate of 71%, with the
          response rates of the cast members in various
          productions ranging from 44.4% to 100%, is
          another potential source of bias. However, the
          degree to which the productions had a
          response rate above or below the mean for the
          sample was not significantly related to the
          number of injuries sustained in their current
          production (F(119)=0.43, p=0.52) or to whether
          they sustained an injury in their current
          production (F(119)=0.25, p=0.63). Likewise,
          having a 100% response rate versus a less than
          perfect response rate was unrelated to the
          number of injuries (F(1>19)=1.9, p=0.19) or
          whether the performer sustained an injury
          (F(119)=0.11, p=0.75). These findings suggest
          that the non-respondents may be similar to the
          respondents.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Statistical Analysis and Variable Selection</h3>
          <p>The survey questionnaire (appendix) consisted
          of self reported items designed to provide
          information about theatrical injuries and possible
          risk factors. The questionnaire was based
          on our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a> survey<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> with input from an
          official of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(British_trade_union)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">British Actors' Equity Association</span></a>
          (<span class="person">Hilary Strange</span>, Senior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre" target="_blank"><span class="entity">West End Theatre</span></a> Organiser).
          In the covering letter from the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(British_trade_union)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">British Actors' Equity Association</span></a>, injury was
          defined as follows: "Injury constitutes any
          theatre-related injury resulting in physical
          damage to the person. Please report any
          injuries you have sustained even those not
          resulting in missed performances."</p>
          <p>For the initial risk factor analysis, unconditional
          logistic regression was used to generate
          odds ratios (ORs) for predictor variables,
           adjusted for the following covariates: number
           of weeks with the current production; number
           of performances with the current production;
           and number of minutes on stage each performance.
           Continuous predictors (height, age, etc),
           were categorised by quartiles of their distributions.
           The outcome for all analyses was
           whether the respondent indicated that they had
           been injured over the course of their current
           production.</p>
           <p>As recommended when developing multivariable logistic regression models through
           stepwise procedures,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b02">2</a> all variables that predicted
           injury with even moderate probability of
           significance (p < 0.25) were further tested with
           a criterion for inclusion in the final model
           being more restrictive (p < 0.15). These selected
           models were further expanded by the forced
           inclusion of the three covariates implemented
           in the earlier risk factor analysis.</p>

        <h3>Characteristics of the study population</h3>
        <p>Tables 1 and 2 present the demographic characteristics of the performers. The performers
        sustained 2.4 injuries per 1000 performances
        and 2.1 injuries per 1000 hours performing on
        stage during their current production. For
        dancers and actors, respectively, 18.5% and
        43.1 % of injuries resulted in at least one missed
        performance. For the three most recent
        injuries, 60.8% of all performers thought that
        their injuries were preventable.</p>

        <h3>Risk factors for injuries</h3>
        <p>The initial risk factor analysis identified various
        risk factors that significantly influence the risk
        of injury for performers (table 3) : the perform
        ers' sex; age; age when they began instruction;
        duration as professional; previously injured;
        previously missed performing due to injury;
        physical demands of the role; and amount of
        choreography in the show.</p>
        <p>As actors and dancers may have different
        patterns of risk factors,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> a series of pairwise
        interactions with the type of performer and
        each predictor were modelled after the initial
        models (table 3). Of these moderating effects
        tested, the following were significant (p < 0.05):
        sex, age, height, body mass, duration as professional,
        previously injured, previously missed
        performing due to injury, currently smoker,
        and performed on a raked (angled) stage. Male
        sex (OR (95% confidence interval (95% CI))
        0.5 (0.3 to 0.9) and 0.5 (0.1 to 2.6) in actors
        and dancers, respectively), older age (OR (95%
        CI) 0.3 (0.1 to 0.6) and 1.8 (0.4 to 7.8) in
        actors and dancers, respectively), and a longer
        duration as professional (OR (95% CI) 0.4
        (0.2 to 0.9) and 1.2 (0.2 to 5.8) in actors and
        dancers, respectively), were significant protective
        factors only in the actor subpopulation.
        The following were significant risk factors only
        in actors: previously injured (OR (95% CI) 4.4
        (2.3 to 8.8) and 3.8 (0.8 to 17.5) in actors and
        dancers, respectively), previously missing per
        formance due to injury (OR (95% CI) 1.8 (1.0
        to 3.4) and 1.9 (0.5 to 6.5) in actors and dancers,
        respectively), and performed on a raked
        stage (OR (95% CI) 1.8 (1.0 to 3.2) and 2.0
        (0.4 to 10.2) in actors and dancers, respectively).</p>

            <p> Analysis of risk factors for injury in the current production (n-269).</p>
            <p>Results were calculated with single predictor logistic models with control for the number of per
               formances with that production, weeks with that production, and minutes on stage per show. Of
               the total sample, 124 were injured during their current production. The continuous risk factors
               were coded into two additional binary variables reflecting the two extreme quartiles of risk factor
               distributions in reference to the sex specific norm of each type of performer.
               Physical demands ranged from 1 (least) to 5 (most). Amount of choreography ranged from 0
               (none) to 3 (heavy).</p>

        <h3>Injuries</h3>
        <p>Table 5 lists the number and sites of injuries
        from the current and previous productions for
        the dancers and actors. Previous productions
        include all earlier professional and amateur
        productions. In current productions, lower
        extremity injuries (mostly of the knee and
        ankle) were the most common for dancers
        (52.2%o) and actors (43.2%) with neck and
        back injuries the second most common type for
        all performers. There were many other sites of
        injuries including the larynx or vocal cord
        strain as detailed. The relative percentages of
        sites of injury from earlier productions were
        similar to those from current productions.</p>

      <p> This is the first epidemiological survey of injuries

       an average of 0.87 injuries per performer for

       the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"><span class="place">United States</span></a><a class="biblioRef" href="#b04">4</a> and professional dancers of

       60.8% of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> performers thought that
       their injuries were preventable. Most
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a><a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> performers saw non
       physicians for their injuries. Although there is
       widespread use of non-physician providers
       among the general population in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"><span class="place">United States</span></a> <a class="biblioRef" href="#b06">6</a>, this is not the case in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" target="_blank"><span class="place">United Kingdom</span></a>. Performers may wish to obtain rapidly
      available physical treatments.</p>
      <h3>Healthcare Providers and Diagnoses</h3>
      <p>Table 6 provides the types of healthcare professionals
      seen and diagnoses given for the injuries
      as reported by the performers. Medical attention
      was sought for 92% of the injuries to
      dancers and 73% of the injuries to actors. Most
      dancers and actors saw non-physicians, most
      commonly physiotherapists, masseurs, chiropractors,
      and acupuncturists. Ear, nose, and
      throat physicians were seen by 4.9% of actors
      for voice or larynx injuries. Sprains and strains
      were the most common diagnoses for the injuries of all performers.</p>
      <p>Several variables influence the likelihood of
      injury for performers. In both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a>
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a>,<a class="biblioRef" href="#b01">1</a> performers with the highest
      level of physical demands are at increased risk
      of injury by a factor of about 3. In this survey,
      dancers in productions with greater amounts of
      choreography were 2.1 times more likely to
      sustain injuries. A history of previous injuries
      and previously missed performances due to
      injury also significantly increased the risk of
      injuries for actors in the current production. As
      in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a> survey, women performers are
      more likely to sustain injuries than men.
      Although the explanation is not known,
      wearing high heeled shoes may contribute.</p>
      <p>A raked stage is a stage that is angled down
      toward the audience to improve the view. The
      percentage of the slope in the productions sur
      veyed ranged from 3% to 10%. Raked stages
      can lead to increased injuries because of the
      performers' accomodating shift backwards in
      their centre of gravity.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b07">7</a> In the current study,
      performing on a raked stage was a significant
      risk factor for injury in actors only whereas on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a>, performing on a raked stage was a
      significant risk factor for dancers but not
      actors. These findings may be explained by the
      presence of more actors and fewer dancers in
      the current study compared with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a>
      survey leading to differences in the power to
      detect significant relations.</p>
      <p>This investigation may be useful for the
      growing number of physicians and other health
      professionals who are involved in performing
      arts medicine.<a class="biblioRef" href="#b08">8</a> Primary prevention is another
      application as one of the significant risk factors,
      raked stages, can be modified. With the
      findings from our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway" target="_blank"><span class="place">Broadway</span></a> survey, the <time datetime="1996">1996</time>

      (<span class="person">Kenneth Greenwood</span> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(British_trade_union)" target="_blank"><span class="entity">British Actors' Equity Association</span></a>, personal communication).
      Also, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> survey was influential in
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank"><span class="place">West End</span></a> production contract to be
      completed on <time datetime="1998-01-12">12 January 1998</time> (<span class="person">Hilary Strange</span>

      personal communication). In a new clause, if a
      performer is required to work on a steeply
      raked stage, the employer will provide a "rake
      specialist" (usually a physiotherapist) to show
      performers how to work safely on a raked sur
      face with an exercise programme and will provide
      continuous supervision and support. This
      study may also be helpful for the planning of
      healthcare provider needs by theatrical unions
       and production companies<a class="biblioRef" href="#b04">4</a> as well as for the
       evaluation and prevention of injuries to theatrical
       students and non-professionals worldwide.</p>
