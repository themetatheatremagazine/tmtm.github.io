        <p class="capital"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a> was the name given to the first international festival of
     women in experimental theatre, organized by <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/users/jillgreenhalgh" target="_blank"><span class="person">Jill Greenhalgh</span></a> and a team of
     women from the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nb2005-6984/" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Cardiff Laboratory Theatre</span></a>
 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" target="_blank"><span class="place">Wales</span></a> in <time datetime="1986-08">August 1986</time>. It is
     a name resonant with all kinds of meanings, summoning up images of
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" target="_blank"><span class="person">Mary Magdalene</span></a>, the woman who was both Outsider and Chosen One,
     harlot and companion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus" target="_blank"><span class="person">Christ</span></a>, dancer and mourner, public property and
     model of piety. Significantly over the last 20 years, the period of growth of
     the international women's movement, the figure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" target="_blank"><span class="person">Mary Magdalene</span></a> has
     become a subject for feminist artists, writers, painters, and theatre practitioners
     in many countries and therefore, in devising a name for the <time datetime="1986-08">August '86</time> festival,
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" target="_blank"><span class="person">Magdalene</span></a> served as a point of reference and a symbol of
     unity, an image of international sisterhood.</p>

     <p>The idea of holding such a festival at all, in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" target="_blank"><span class="place">Britain</span></a> suffering acutely from the effects of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" target="_blank"><span class="person">Margaret Thatcher</span></a>'s conservative economic policies,
     was a daring one, and inevitably the funding presented a major stumbling
     block. The <a href="https://arts.wales/" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Welsh Arts Council</span></a> and the <a href="https://gulbenkian.pt/en/" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation</span></a>
     contributed some money for the event, while those of us who took part
     agreed to accept no more than basic living costs (a room, provided by the
     sympathetic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff" target="_blank"><span class="place">Cardiff</span></a> citizens, and food in the canteen) and some of the
     performers offered shows or workshops to the general public, charging
     admission. It was clear from the outset that the festival would run at a loss,
     though it was hoped that the loss would be minimal (as was indeed the
     case). Nevertheless, despite the financial problems, women from a wide
     range of countries, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" target="_blank"><span class="place">Argentina</span></a>,
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" target="_blank"><span class="place">Belgium</span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia" target="_blank"><span class="place">Czechoslovakia</span></a>,

     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" target="_blank"><span class="place">Wales</span></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany" target="_blank"><span class="place">West Germany</span></a>
     came together to share their work and collaborate in producing a final performance.</p>

     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a> was divided into two distinct phases. Phase I ran for one
     week and was open to the public. It consisted of performances brought by
     individual performers or by small groups (discussed below), discussion
     groups, and workshops on various subjects-voice work, physical work,
     psycho-physical work. Once the first week had ended, the truly innovative
     part of the festival began: Thirty-eight performers, visual artists, directors,
     musicians, technicians, writers, and administrators lived, worked, and
     trained together for two more weeks, prior to a final performance staged
     on two consecutive evenings in a disused potato factory on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff" target="_blank"><span class="place">Cardiff</span></a>
     docks. The transformation of the damp, empty, rat-infested factory into a
     series of performance spaces was something in which we all participated.
     In one case, we shoveled sand onto pallets creating an area filled with sand
     and water in what came to be called "<span class="place">The River Room</span>." We cleaned a vast
     hollow area in which <a href="https://www.jennie-speirs-grant.com/" target="_blank"><span class="person">Jennie Speirs</span></a>, an English sculptress, created tiny,
     beautiful pieces with wood and stones covered in flour. In yet another
     room <span class="person">Cinzia Mascherin</span> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" target="_blank"><span class="place">Italy</span></a> built a tall, slender,
     horse-headed female figure and created an improvisation based on the eternal feminine
     motif of braiding and weaving destinies and cloth.</p>

     <p>The performances in Phase I varied considerably. Some focused
       primarily on the visual, such as the show <em><span class="entity">No Man's Land</span></em>
       by <a href="https://sandrasalmasobiodanza.com/" target="_blank"><span class="person">Sandra Salmaso</span></a> and
     <span class="person">Cinzia Mascherin</span>, or
     <em><span class="entity">Hesitation 3-La presence d'esprit</span></em>
     by <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/users/voix-de-femmes" target="_blank"><span class="person">Brigitte Kaquet</span></a> of
     the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lecirquedivers" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Belgian Cirque Divers</span></a>, a show inspired by a
     <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte" target="_blank"><span class="person">Magritte</span></a> painting. Others were more literary in origin, such as <em><a href="https://helenchadwick.com/a-gift-for-burning/" target="_blank"><span class="entity">A Gift for Burning</span></a></em>,
     <a href="https://helenchadwick.com" target="_blank"><span class="person">Helen Chadwick</span></a>'s
     celebration of the work of eight women poets, or <em><span class="entity">The Stars Are No Nearer</span></em>,
     <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/users/geddy-aniksdal" target="_blank"><span class="person">Geddy Aniksdal</span></a>'s first solo performance created
     especially for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a>
     and based on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath" target="_blank"><span class="person">Sylvia Plath</span></a>. Other performances showed the
     internationalism of the performers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath" target="_blank"><span class="person">Netta Plotsky</span></a>, an Israeli who had
     trained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" target="_blank"><span class="place">Japan</span></a> with the Odin Teatret of
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark" target="_blank"><span class="place">Denmark</span></a>, performed her <em><span class="entity">Life
     Among Forms</span></em>, a fusion of elements from different performance traditions.</p>

     <p> The performances which touched me most deeply were those that generated
       intense emotional energy, an energy that united performers and
     spectators and moved us to deeper questioning of our own work. Among
     such performances were <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/users/lis-hughes-jones" target="_blank"><span class="person">Lis Hughes Jones</span></a>'s show about the <em>desaparacidos</em> of
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina" target="_blank"><span class="place">Argentina</span></a>
, <em><span class="entity">Songs of Griefand Hope</span></em>;
     the Argentinian <span class="person">Garciella Serra</span>'s <em><a href="http://criticateatral2021.org/transcripciones/2834_850619.php" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Facundina</span></a></em>,
     the story of a Chinquana Indian woman who lived to the age of 110;
     and <a href="http://www.contexts.com.pl/en/artists/jolanta-krukowska" target="_blank"><span class="person">Jolanta Krukowska</span></a>'s extraordinary ballet-sculpture
     <em><span class="entity">A Dance About . .</span></em>, in which the Polish performer
     ritually placed great stones in a plastic
     bag suspended above her head, naming each one <q>my marriage . . . my
     work ...</q> until the bag disintegrated and the studio floor was littered
     once again with rubble. Through the many different performances certain
     key lines could be discerned-the drive for women to find a space for
     themselves in a cluttered or antagonistic world, the power of words breaking
     the silence of women, and equally, the power of silence itself with the
     mystery it holds.</p>

     <p> Trying to recall the great rush of images that were offered to me in such
     a short space of time, I find myself returning to the image of women
     raising themselves up from kneeling or horizontal positions and standing
     vertically, often with their arms upraised, sometimes in pain but most
     often in some form of self-assertion. Even the protagonist who committed
     suicide in <em><a href="https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b7f985dc3" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Madame Bovary Downtown</span></a></em>, presented by
     <span class="person">Anna Lica</span> of the <span class="entity">Danish Theater Gruppen Marquez</span>,
     did not leave us with an image of despair but with feelings of rage.</p>

     <p>The rage and power generated in many of the performances was part of
     what <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Zofia Kalinska</span></a> called "demonic energy." <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Kalinska</span></a>, who is over 50,
     was the oldest performer present and one of the most experienced. Her
     production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Genet" target="_blank"><span class="person">Gene Genet</span></a>'s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maids" target="_blank"><span class="entity">The Maids</span></a></em> had taken a year to rehearse. Staged
     in a cellar, the half-naked, white-faced maids reenacted their struggle for
     power against the terrifying <span class="person">Madame</span>, played by <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Kalinska</span></a> herself,
     prowling around the edges of the performance space. Having seen so many
     productions of this play in which <span class="person">Madame</span> is presented as a silly,
     upperclass woman with an entirely frivolous life, it was a welcome change to see
     <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Kalinska</span></a> inspire fear in her maids-reminding me of <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne_Cixous" target="_blank"><span class="person">Helene Cixous</span></a>'s
     comment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Genet" target="_blank"><span class="person">Gene Genet</span></a> should be seen as a truly feminine writer.</p>

     <p> In the latter half of the 1980s the term "postfeminism" has come
       increasingly into use, not in ways that suggest that feminism as such is dead or
     dying, but rather that out of the first wave of feminism a new way of
     thinking has emerged, just as structuralism laid the foundations for the
     philosophizing of poststructuralism. In this postfeminist period, the wave
     of plays about the hard lot of women in the world has given way to
     investigation of the nature of feminist art, to debates on the existence of a
     feminist aesthetic, to discussion about the vexed terminology of
     "femi-nine/feminist/female" and its application to art. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a> reflected the postfeminist impulse, so that the performers constantly engaged with
     issues that went far deeper than those immediately recognizable as feminist
     and struggled with the fundamental problem of coherence versus shapelessness.

    <p>An essential basis of the second phase of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a>, a period of intense
     training and work, was that there should be no formalized structure. Any
     structure could emerge, but none should be predetermined. Consequently,
     <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/users/jillgreenhalgh" target="_blank"><span class="person">Jill Greenhalgh</span></a> abdicated her role as director of the project, refusing to take
     charge or to agree to the presence of a director unless the group as a whole
     decided in favor. Eventually two women, one performer and one visual
     artist, began to take on the directorial role for the final performance, but
     their decision caused some problems and the old power hierarchies reared
     their heads. The decision to begin Phase II without a structure, after the
     carefully timetabled events of Phase I, was a daring one. A kind of
     structure emerged almost immediately in that the visual artists, as a group, went
     to begin work on the factory space, while the others agreed on a daily
     training program in which each woman could offer to lead a session and
     participation was completely open. Meanwhile, <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Kalinska</span></a>'s workshop on
     the demonic woman had led to a group of women, myself included,
     meeting together every day to work on what <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Kalinska</span></a> called her "<span class="entity">magic circle</span>",
     a ritualized moving together in a circle, sometimes for hours on end,
     establishing tracks and patterns and improvising in and out of the circle as
     we went on. From this "unstructured" time certain lines began to develop,
     such as work in small groups like <a href="https://themagdalenaproject.org/en/content/zofia-kalinska-1931-2018" target="_blank"><span class="person">Kalinska</span></a>'s, and a certain distancing
     between the visual artists and the others. The split between visual and
     other artists was not entirely happy-the one casualty of the festival was
     the departure after two weeks of a visual artist who found the environment
     unproductive.</p>

     <p>
     <a href="https://sandrasalmasobiodanza.com/" target="_blank"><span class="person">Sandra Salmaso</span></a> attempted to describe her own working process as a
     performer in terms that could well apply to the whole of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a>:</p>

     <blockquote>
       <p class="bq">I have to learn how to see. Everything is there in the world, and I can
       imagine the things which don't exist ... I think that from seeing I will
       be able to arrive at intuition. And intuition is daring, guessing, seeing
       more than is there. Creativity for me is the instant in which I am able
       to see: creating is seeing. . . . Theatre is the space where the fog can
       sometimes lift...</p>
     </blockquote>

     <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a> began in just such a state of fogginess, and steadily moved
     toward clarity. In the process of working together we discovered that
     archetypal images were beginning to emerge. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Triple Goddess</span></a> was everywhere in improvisations that developed completely separately from
     one another-in the choice of red, black, and white as dominant colors; in
     the representations of the three stages of woman as Virgin Huntress,
     Mother, and Hag; in the appearance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophelia" target="_blank"><span class="person">Ophelia</span></a>,
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea" target="_blank"><span class="person">Medea</span></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank"><span class="person">Cassandra</span></a>,
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clytemnestra" target="_blank"><span class="person">Clytemnestra</span></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne" target="_blank"><span class="person">Ariadne</span></a>;
     in the images of birth in water, the labyrinth, the
     cauldron, the ceremonial table, and the great bed of death.
     </p>

     <p> The final performance was anticlimactic after the two weeks of intense
     creative work, particularly since the best improvisations had all happened
     during training sessions, but it did show glimmers of what had been going
     on and audience response was positive. Opinion had been divided among
     the group of 38 as to whether a final public performance was a useful
     conclusion to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a>. Certainly the dynamics of the work changed in
     the three days immediately preceding the performance as the pressures of
     making a show took over from the process of exploration that had been so
     successfully developing. Moreover, much of the work begun in the training
     sessions had to be discarded and what was eventually seen by the public
     represented only a small portion of the many lines of work that had been
     developing. One particularly regrettable loss was much of the singing, an
     activity that had united the group, bringing together the various separate
     strands.</p>

     <p> Assessing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a> <time datetime="1986">'86</time> is difficult, partly because the experience we
     had was so intense and partly because it is an absurdity to try to describe
     irrational, intuitive, feminine processes in the rational language of criticism
     that is so essentially a male instrument. I can say that as an academic, I
     learned a lot, as a writer I was given a great deal of inspiration, as a human
     being I felt reinforced by the enabling environment. This view is shared by
     many of those who participated, as the letters I have received testify.

       <p class="bq">Stillness is maybe the word that most strongly tells of what happened
       for me during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a>, if one can imagine stillness as a ball of energy,
       stillness as a beautiful line of poetry. It happened in two ways.
       In the words, the ideas, the organization, and the presence of these
       women who had so much to say, such strength to express, such experience
       to enrich, and who did it in a quiet, silent way. And in the practical
       work in the rooms, with the training and performance scenes,
       where the research was "just to be" or repetition, silent figures, a photograph,
       stillness, on a chair, on a bed, in the water, a song.</p>
       <p class="bq">And at the end again I was struck by the beauty ... Was "nothing"
       happening, "nothing" said? or was it reaching out for the essential and
       magic of the Japanese dancer standing between the red curtains? when
       nothing seems to be happening and all is action. The silent, apparently
       still, energy.</p>
     </blockquote>

    <p> There are plans for future <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a> work, but as yet those plans are
     unclear. Venues have been proposed in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" target="_blank"><span class="place">Europe</span></a>, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" target="_blank"><span class="place">South America</span></a>, in the
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" target="_blank"><span class="place">United States</span></a>. Suggestions have been made that different formats should
     be devised, that 38 was too large a group or too small, that there should be
     no public performance but rather one or more open days, that three weeks
     is too short a time, and so forth. What all these suggestions indicate is the
     degree of interest in the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magdalena_Project" target="_blank"><span class="entity">Magdalena</span></a>, in a project which brings
     together women from many cultures involved in experimental theatre
     work with the common aim of investigating through practical experience
     the crucial feminist question of whether there is a specifically female theatre.</p>
