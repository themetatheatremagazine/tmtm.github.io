            <p class="publicationDate">Sept. 21, 2017</p>
            <p class="capital">The evening on Mulberry Street was already thickening with the aroma of fried dough and grilled sausage when a knight in faded armor coursed through the crowd in a shopping cart.</p>
            <p><q>Puppet show in the church,</q> shouted a man pushing the cart. <q>Marionettes in the church.</q></p>
            <p>The popular street festival that is the <span class="entity">Feast of San Gennaro</span> is a concerted heave every September to celebrate the culture and traditions of <span class="place">Little Italy in Manhattan</span>.</p>
            <p>Much like the neighborhood, those traditions have been fading for years, but here was this errant knight being conveyed by a couple of locals doing their part to revive a tradition: <span class="entity">the Marionettes of Mulberry Street</span>.</p>
            <p><q>The Marionettes are back on Mulberry Street</q> yelled Tony De Nonno, 70, an aficionado of a specific style of Sicilian puppet theater of which the hand-carved knight was an example.</p>
            <p>Nearly a century ago, homesick Italian immigrants flocked to small theaters in <span class="place">Little Italy</span> for operatic renditions of medieval tales by such puppets.</p>
            <p><q>Back then, every Italian neighborhood had marionettes and a theater,</q> said <span class="person">Susie Bruno</span>, 78, whose family, the Manteos, were the longest lasting of <span class="place">New York City</span>’s puppet troupes.</p>

            <p>They ran nightly performances in the <span class="place">Manteo Marionette Storefront Theater</span> on <span class="place">Mulberry Street</span> until it closed in <time datetime="1939">1939</time>, and was replaced with a rectory for the <span class="place">Shrine Church of Most Precious Blood</span>.</p>
            <p>More recent generations of Manteos revived the shows in the 1970s and 1980s using a portable theater. The tradition has continued in <span class="place">Sicily</span>, but not here.
            <p>On Wednesday, <span class="person">Mr. De Nonno</span>, a filmmaker, educator and friend of the <span class="entity">Manteo family</span>, gathered a few Manteo puppets donated to the <span class="place"></span>Italian American Museum</span> in <span class="place">Little Italy</span> and prepared to stage a lively presentation on Wednesday night right after Mass in the <span class="place">Shrine church</span>.</p>
            <p><q>We got the feast, a Mass and a puppet show — it’s just like it was 70 years ago,</q> said <span class="person">Bill Russo</span>, director of activities for the church.</p>
            <p>He helped heave <span class="entity">Ronaldo</span>, the armored knight, into the shopping cart to wheel to the church.</p>
            <p>The knight was made nearly a century ago by <span class="person">Agrippino Manteo</span>, Ms. Bruno’s grandfather, who eventually passed down to his son Mike the ability to make puppets that were often taller than 5 feet.</p>
            <p><q>It’s got to weigh 100 pounds – can you imagine needing two guys to carry a puppet,</q> <span class="person">Mr. Russo</span> said. “I don’t know how they handled it onstage.”</p>

            <p>Mr. <span class ="person">De Nonno</span> said, <q>Listen, people in those days, they were bulls, they had endurance.</q></p> 
            <p>Mr. <span class ="person">De Nonno</span> grabbed a smaller puppet knight made for him in the 1970s by Mike Manteo. This puppet was more manageable, at only 40 pounds, and Mr. De Nonno danced the puppet along Mulberry Street weaving through the crowd while he manipulated the sword and shield.</p>
            <p><q>Buonasera,</q> he shouted to the crowd – good evening – as the puppet danced and elicited a kiss from a woman.</p>
            <p><q>That’s the most action I got all year,</q> said the woman,<span class ="person">Marie Corleone</span>, a legal secretary from Brooklyn.</p>
            <p>Mr. <span class ="person">De Nonno</span> and his puppet headed into the church’s rear courtyard on <span class ="place">Mulberry Street</span> where festivalgoers were pinning dollar bills to a statue of <span class ="person">San Gennaro</span> that is carried along during the feast.</p>
            <p><q>My name is Orlando Furioso</q> Mr. <span class ="person">De Nonno</span> bellowed to his audience as he maneuvered his knight, who is based on a medieval hero.</p>
            <p>He told the crowd, <q>These knights in armor were made by magnificent hands,</q> by <span class ="entity">Manteo family</span> members who were <q>artists on many different levels.”</q></p>

            <p>The puppets were meticulously made and operated by the family, which also made the stages, scenery and carried out every aspect of the productions, including the music, Mr. <span class="person">De Nonno</span> said.</p>
            <p>The men did the heavier work, like manipulating the heavy puppets from a bridge over the stage. The women sewed gowns for the courtly heroines with detailed needlework.</p> 
            <p><q>These were consummate actors and they knew how to create captivating characters,</q> said Mr. <span class="person">De Nonno</span>, before he started showing a documentary he made years ago about the <span class="entity">Manteo family</span> <q>It’s One Family: Knock on Wood.</q></p>
            <p>The so-called <span class="entity">Papa Manteo Marionettes</span> came out of puppet theater that thrived in <span class="place">Catania</span>, <span class="place">Sicily</span>, in the 19th century, he said.</p>
            <p><span class="person">Agrippino Manteo</span> brought dozens of puppets to the <span class="place">United States</span> in <time datetime="1919">1919</time> and established a theater in <span class="place">Little Italy</span>, staging nightly performances with the help of his wife, <span class="person">Caterina</span>, and their four sons and daughter, until <time datetime="1939">1939</time>, when one son died of tuberculosis.</p>
            <p><q>The family was crushed,</q> <span class="person">Ms. Bruno</span> said.</p>
            <p>The theater was promptly closed and the family eventually moved to <span class="place">Brooklyn</span>. When the family revived the shows several decades ago, <span class="person">Mike Manteo</span> made marionettes in his Brooklyn shop. He would often turn old hubcaps and metal appliances into sturdy suits of armor for knights that would clash violently onstage.</p>
