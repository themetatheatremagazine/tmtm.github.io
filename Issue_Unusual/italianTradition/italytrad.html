                <p class="capital">The evening on Mulberry Street was already thickening with the aroma of fried dough
                    and grilled sausage when a knight in faded armor coursed through the crowd in a shopping cart.</p>

                    The popular street festival that is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feast_of_San_Gennaro"
                        target="_blank"><span class="entity">Feast of San Gennaro</span></a> is a concerted heave every
                    September to celebrate the culture and traditions of <a

                            class="place">Little Italy</span></a> in Manhattan.Much like the neighborhood, those
                    traditions have been fading for years, but here was this errant knight being conveyed by a couple of
                    locals doing their part to revive a tradition: <span class="entity">the Marionettes of Mulberry Street</span>.<q>The Marionettes are back on Mulberry Street</q> yelled <a

                    the hand-carved knight was an example.</p>
                <p>Nearly a century ago, homesick Italian immigrants flocked to small theaters in <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Italy,_Manhattan" target="_blank"><span
                            class="place">Little Italy</span></a> for operatic renditions of medieval tales by such
                    puppets.<q>Back then, every Italian neighborhood had marionettes and a theater,</q> said <span
                        class="person">Susie Bruno</span>, 78, whose family, the Manteos, were the longest lasting of <a

                <p>They ran nightly performances in the <span class="place">Manteo Marionette Storefront Theater</span>

                    portable theater. The tradition has continued in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily"

                        target="_blank"><span class="place">Little Italy</span></a> and prepared to stage a lively
                    presentation on Wednesday night right after Mass in the <span class="place">Shrine church</span>.<q>We got the feast, a Mass and a puppet show — it’s just like it was 70 years
                        ago,</q> said <span class="person">Bill Russo</span>, director of activities for the church. He
                    helped heave <span class="entity">Ronaldo</span>, the armored knight, into the shopping cart to
                    wheel to the church.</p>
                <p>The knight was made nearly a century ago by <span class="person">Agrippino Manteo</span>, Ms. Bruno’s
                    grandfather, who eventually passed down to his son Mike the ability to make puppets that were often
                    taller than 5 feet.<q>It’s got to weigh 100 pounds – can you imagine needing two guys to carry a
                        puppet,</q> <span class="person">Mr. Russo</span> said. “I don’t know how they handled it
                    onstage.”</p>
