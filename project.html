<h2>Slavic Gospels Style - Before 1500</h2>
<h3>Choice</h3>    
  <p>The Gospel style is inspired by a family of gospel manuscripts of the slavic orthodox tradition. Of this family, one of the most famous groups are the Ostromir Gospels, beautiful illuminated manuscripts with orthodox-style decorations, mainly concentrated around the title, the first letter of the chapter and the footer.
  </p>
  <img src="https://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/russia/media/Ostromir/OstromirTitel.jpg" alt="Ostromir Gospel">
  <img src="https://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/russia/media/Ostromir/OstromirSample3.jpg" alt="Ostromir Gospel">
  <p>The choice is motivated both by a personal appreciation of these gospels, on which I did my thesis for the bachelor's degree, and by the assignment of creating a web style based on before printing books.
    One of the main difficulties of recreating this as a web style was finding appropriate and compliant images for the header and the footer: while being easily found in a digitized format, they were not in a shape or quality that could be used in a web page, so we sorted on a different solution, which was trying to recreate the position of the decorations and illuminations, the font and the page layout. 
  </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The background is just the image of a simple sheet of parchment, repeated x times as the length of the page, which stretches for the whole width of it. The second background fixed on the top of the page is inspired by the decorations around the title of the slavic gospels</p>
  <img src="Gospel/images/border-left.png" alt="border left">
  <img src="Gospel/images/ornament.jpg" alt="Slavic ornament">
  <img src="Gospel/images/footer.png" alt="footer">
<p>The palette and the kind of ornaments are pretty similar, while the only difference is on the shape of it: older slavic gospels heavily rely on a rectangular decoration, but none of the ones I found where suited for the task of a both readable and responsive header frame: two mirrors of the first image were used, so that they could move alongside the viewport. 
  A more rectangular frame was used instead for the images:</p>
  <img src="Gospel/images/dog.png" alt="Alkonost">
  <img src="Gospel/images/frame.png" alt="flower frame">
<p>Floral patterns are often used throughout the orthodox, byzantine and slavic decorative tradition, alongside the Rushnik pagan tradition. The problem in using the original frames and the ones found throughout the internet was the lack of vector images or PNGs that could easily be corrected without finer editing skills. 
  This style heavily influenced the illustrations by Ivan Jakovlevič Bilibin, a XX sec illustrator and artist who painted illustrations for e.g. Puskin fairy tales. One favourite creature often painted by him was the Alkonost, a mithical bird of paradise, and a tribute to this was made in the gryphon-looking monster around the edges of the footer. For the last paragraph of the text a decoration was used as the decorated end of chapter of the gospel. 
  </p>
<h3>Fonts and Layout</h3>
<p>The script used in the gospel manuscripts was a kind of minuscule resembling the uncial byzantine script. Indeed the slavic orthodox tradition relies heavily on the byzantine style, so an uncial latin font was chosen to resemble at best the slavic minuscule. 
  One of the features that stand out to the eye when looking at the Slavic minuscule is the concentration of abbreviations, terminals, serifs and diacritical marks, which recreate a line of full letters, each almost independent. Trying to recreate this in a latin script was almost impossible, so we sorted to add just a pixel of letter spacing. 
  </p>
<p>The font color looks between a red and brown color, so a ‘color: #520404;’ was chosen: 
  The capital letter instead was simplified for the almost impossibility of finding a font that resembles exactly the beautiful decorated letter, so the proposed solution was to create either a background image with a pattern that could generalize the decoration and then apply on top the letter or to find a general illuminated capital letter. The latter solution seemed more readable and less difficult to look and read at in a web context. For this the ‘Camelot’ font was used. 
  The title script in the gospel resembled the uncial script but bolder and with more serif, especially in the general family and in later time. For this the Angel Rhapsody font was used, which relies on serif, decorations and an almost gothic look. The color #D4AF37 was used. 
  </p>
  <img src="https://www.colorhexa.com/520404.png" alt="brownish red">
  <img src="https://www.colorhexa.com/d4af37.png" alt="golden yellow">
<p>For the layout I maintained both the one-column and the two columns layouts, with the latter only for bigger viewports. The gap between the columns was calculated as 3 times the length of a single letter, 1.3 rem.</p>

<!--2040 STYLE-->
<div id="2040Style">
  <h2>PostVaporwave - 2040</h2>
  <h3>Choice</h3>
  <p>The 2040’s style is not an ideally futuristic style, but is the realizations of what some people, 30 years before, imagined the future to be like. 
    Vaporwave in itself is a microgenre of electronic music, a visual art style, and an Internet meme that emerged in the 2010s, and keeped its mainstream until now. 
    One of the heritage of this style are voiceless background music, often packed in playlists, that is listened to “chill” or while working on something else, 
    often on a personal computer, such as famous youtube playlists “lofi hip hop radio - beats to relax/study to”  and so on.
    </p>
  <p>A lot of meme playlist emerged from this style, remarkably in Italy “lofi Alberto Angela mix - beats to relax/quarantine to” , “space lo-fi” and so on. Meme culture has made its way to the mainstream in the last two decades, and it’s not impossible to imagine that this will keep its momentum for decades to come. 
    During the quarantine of 2020 “vaporwave” like playlists made a comeback with a new style, while a dystopian, apocalyptic and virtual imagery made its way to a wider population. 
    This style is a combination of all these cultural references, without a solid connection just as the vaporwave style, with an embedded Spotify player with a voiceless playlist and an “easter-egg” in the layout. 
    </p>
  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>The whole style is made to relax and please the eyes. 
    A colored, gradient background which slowly moves is used to represent waves, with a future-funk / vaporwave palette. 
    The whole palette is based on pastel colors, with white as the text color. The last color, #ffd700, was used for the dotted border and the text selection. The gold is not so often used 
    in vaporwave, but it's common in the future-funk, cyberpunk styles, also it sitted well with the palette while creating conrast with the actual text.

  <p>The header gifs are kind of staples of the waporwave style: a greek column and a 3-D, silver column made of bodies that becomes visible when hovering. 
  </p>
  <img src="2040/images/column.gif" alt="vapor column">
  <img src="2040/images/peoplecolumn.gif" alt="vapor men column">
  <img src="2040/images/sun.gif" alt="sun">
  <p>A sunset gif, another common symbol of vaporwave, was made as background of a capitalized first letter. 
    The responsive layout of the page is such that on shrinking, the text column becomes one as the greek column on the header. 
    </p>
  <h3>Fonts and Layout</h3>
  <p>The fonts used are both sans serif; Montserrat is a plain typeface, regular in dimension and without changes in the stroke width, while Roboto is largely geometric, with open curves and allows letters to be settled into their natural width. Both fonts were chosen to resemble the aesthetic and offer a more natural reading rhythm, such as humanist and serif types
    The title is bold and has a little reduced letter spacing, to almost make the white of the letters touch, while a dense web of text-shadow of the #E485F8 color creates an almost three-dimensional effect.
    </p>
  <h3>Beyond Visual</h3>
  <p>To enhance the 2040 style I decided to add a Spotify player via jquery, because music is an essential part of the vaporwave style and connects all the aesthetical references I chose for this style.
